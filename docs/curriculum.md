## Course Overview

This 10-week Advertising Video Editing course is a practice-driven exploration of video editing within the context of persuasive media and advertising. The class combines film theory, technical mastery, and critical experimentation in an **atelier-style learning environment** (studio-based, "learning by doing") to achieve excellence in both creative and technical skills.

Students will trace the evolution of editing techniques from early cinema pioneers (Lumière Brothers, Georges Méliès, Segundo de Chomón) through the Soviet montage school (Lev Kuleshov, Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein) up to modern auteurs like Quentin Tarantino, examining how each era's innovations inform advertising today.

### What You'll Master

**Technical Excellence**

- Industry-standard tools: Adobe Premiere Pro for non-linear editing and After Effects for motion graphics
- Professional workflows: organization, proxy editing, color grading, sound design
- AI-assisted editing tools for efficiency (auto-transcription, auto-reframe, motion tracking)
- Platform-specific optimization (TV, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Vimeo)

**Creative Storytelling**

- Narrative structures for 15–60 second persuasive videos
- Pre-production planning: briefs, scripts, storyboards
- Editing theory: Kuleshov Effect, Gestalt principles, continuity vs. montage
- Breaking the rules creatively (jump cuts, nonlinear narratives, experimental techniques)

**Critical Thinking**

- Psychology of perception and how editing influences audiences
- Ethical considerations: manipulation vs. persuasion, stereotyping, truthfulness
- Media theory: McLuhan, Debord, Naomi Klein, Jean Kilbourne
- Feminist and anti-consumerist perspectives on advertising

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Apply Classic & Contemporary Editing Techniques** – Demonstrate key editing principles from early splicing tricks to Soviet montage
2. **Utilize Industry Tools & Workflows Proficiently** – Operate Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects professionally
3. **Integrate Pre-Production Planning** – Develop editing projects from concept to completion
4. **Critically Analyze and Contextualize Media** – Analyze existing advertisements for editing style and psychological impact
5. **Adapt Content to Platform and Audience** – Understand how distribution channels influence editing formats
6. **Design Persuasive Advertising Videos** – Craft short-form videos that tell a clear story
7. **Research and Reflect Through Practice** – Engage in practice-led research by experimenting with techniques

## Our Approach to AI

> *"AI exists to AMPLIFY human intention, not to replace it."*

We follow these principles:

- **AI as Apprentice** — The professor decides; AI proposes
- **AI as Amplifier** — AI handles the mechanical; humans handle the meaningful
- **AI as Teacher** — We ask AI to explain, not just to do
- **Human Oversight** — All AI-generated content is reviewed, verified, and understood before use

### Ethical Commitments

This project aligns with established ethical frameworks:

- **ACM Code of Ethics** — Contribute to society, avoid harm, be honest
- **UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendation** — Proportionality, safety, fairness, sustainability, human oversight, transparency

### The Human Flourishing Test

Before every AI-assisted task, we ask:

1. Does this **reduce suffering** or **increase joy**?
2. Am I **learning** through this process, or just **copying**?
3. Will my future self **thank me** for this work?

### Transparency

- All AI-generated content has been reviewed and understood by the author
- Security implications have been evaluated
- The author assumes full responsibility for the final implementation

## Teaching Methodology

### The Atelier Model

The course follows an **atelier model of teaching**, meaning class sessions resemble a creative workshop guided by the instructor (as a "master" facilitator) with students learning through active practice and iterative feedback.

Each week is split into **two 2-hour sessions**:

- **Session A:** Short lecture/seminar introducing theory and exemplars, followed by screenings and analysis
- **Session B:** Hands-on lab where students apply concepts immediately in exercises or ongoing projects

## Assessment & Projects

### 1. Advertisement Analysis (25%)

Early in the term, each student conducts a critical analysis of an existing short advertisement or iconic edited sequence.

**Due:** Week 4

### 2. Team "Edit-On-Camera" Videothon (25%)

Around mid-semester, students participate in a fast-paced team project simulating real-world creative sprints.

**Due:** Week 6-7

### 3. Final Persuasive Video Project (50%)

The major assessment is an individual final project where each student produces an original short advertising video.

**Due:** Week 10 (Final Screening)
