## Context & Learning Goals

### Historical Foundation
- **Lumière Brothers (1895):** First public film screenings, "actualities" with no editing—single-shot documentation of reality
- **Georges Méliès (1902):** "Father of special effects," pioneered in-camera tricks using stop-motion and substitution cuts
- **Segundo de Chomón (1906-1912):** "The Spanish Méliès," advanced hand-coloring, optical illusions, and surreal narratives
- **Edwin S. Porter (1903):** *The Great Train Robbery*, early continuity editing and parallel action

### Technical Skills to Introduce
- In-camera editing techniques (planning shots in sequence)
- Stop-motion and substitution cuts in Premiere Pro
- Precise frame-by-frame editing
- Speed/duration manipulation
- Masking and compositing basics
- Hand-drawn animation and rotoscoping concepts

### Critical Thinking Objectives
- How did technical limitations inspire creative innovation?
- What can modern editors learn from early cinema constraints?
- How do "trick films" relate to modern advertising spectacle?
- The relationship between planning and editing

### Week 2 Success Indicators
By the end of Week 2, students should be able to:
- ✓ Understand the evolution from no-edit actualities to trick films
- ✓ Execute precise frame-by-frame editing
- ✓ Create simple in-camera effects using stop-motion techniques
- ✓ Appreciate the importance of pre-planning for complex edits
- ✓ Connect early cinema innovations to modern advertising techniques

## Session A: Actualities vs. Trick Films (2 hours)

### Opening (10 minutes)

> *"The first filmmakers had no rules to follow, so they invented everything. In their limitations, they found infinite creativity."*

**Recap Week 1:**
- Quick review: McLuhan (medium = message), editing as persuasion
- Student exercise check-in: "How did the pacing exercise go? What surprised you?"

**Today's Journey:**
"We're traveling back to 1895-1910, to the birth of cinema itself. Before Hollywood, before MTV, before TikTok—how did editing begin?"

**Central Question:** "If you had a camera that could only shoot for 50 seconds at a time, and you couldn't edit in post-production, how would you tell a story?"

---

### Core Lecture: The Birth of Cinema (50 minutes)

#### 1. The Lumière Brothers: Reality Without Edits (15 min)

**Historical Context:**
- December 28, 1895: First public film screening in Paris
- Auguste and Louis Lumière invented the Cinématographe (camera + projector)
- Created "actualities" (actualités): short documentary-style films of everyday life

**Key Films to Screen:**

**"L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat" (Arrival of a Train, 1896) - 50 seconds**
- Single shot, fixed camera
- Train approaches from distance to foreground
- Legend: Audiences screamed and ran from the approaching train
- **No editing**—just reality unfolding

**"La Sortie de l'usine Lumière à Lyon" (Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory, 1895) - 46 seconds**
- First film ever shown publicly
- Workers streaming out of factory gates
- Again: single shot, no cuts

**Analysis Points:**
- **Composition:** Careful framing (train enters from specific angle, workers flow through centered gate)
- **Timing:** Knowing when to start/stop camera (the "edit" happens in real-time)
- **Spectacle:** Movement itself was magical to 1895 audiences
- **"Editing":** The choice of what to film and when to start/stop IS an editorial decision

**Discussion:** "Is this editing? What choices did the Lumières make?"

**Connection to Advertising:**
- Modern "slice of life" ads echo this realism
- Documentary-style advertising (authentic, unpolished)
- The power of "just showing" something without manipulation

> *"The first edit was not a cut between two shots, but the choice of what single shot to capture."*

#### 2. Georges Méliès: The Magician's Cinema (20 min)

**Historical Context:**
- Georges Méliès (1861-1938): Stage magician turned filmmaker
- Owned Théâtre Robert-Houdin in Paris
- Discovered "substitution cut" by accident when camera jammed

**The Legendary Discovery:**
Story: Méliès was filming a Paris street when his camera jammed. He fixed it and continued filming. When he developed the film, a bus had "magically" transformed into a hearse! This accident revealed the power of the cut.

**Key Films to Screen:**

**"Le Voyage dans la Lune" (A Trip to the Moon, 1902) - 14 minutes**
- First science fiction film
- Famous image: Rocket hitting the moon's eye
- Multiple "scenes" (tableaux) edited together
- Hand-painted color in some versions
- Cost: 10,000 francs (enormous for the time)

**Screening Strategy:**
- Show 3-4 key scenes (not entire film due to time):
  1. Scientists planning voyage (0:00-1:30)
  2. Rocket launch and moon landing (3:00-4:30)
  3. Moon creatures and escape (8:00-10:00)
  4. Ocean splash and celebration (12:00-14:00)

**Techniques to Identify:**

1. **Substitution Cut (Stop-Motion):**
   - Stop camera, change scene, restart
   - Objects appear/disappear
   - People transform
   - Example: Umbrella turns into mushroom

2. **Multiple Exposure:**
   - Film same frame twice
   - Ghosts and transparent figures
   - Layering impossible elements

3. **Painted Sets & Forced Perspective:**
   - Theatrical backgrounds
   - Creating depth and fantasy worlds

4. **Hand-Coloring:**
   - Each frame painted by hand (200+ workers)
   - Adds magical quality

**Analysis Discussion:**
- "How is this different from Lumière's approach?"
- "What 'editing' techniques do you see?"
- "How did Méliès plan these effects?"

**The Key Insight:**
Méliès essentially **edited in-camera**. He planned every shot, every transformation, every effect BEFORE filming. Post-production editing was minimal—just splicing scenes together.

**Connection to Advertising:**
- Modern VFX in commercials (product transformations)
- Stop-motion advertising (California Raisins, Wallace & Gromit)
- The power of visual surprise and delight
- Meticulous planning = successful execution

> *"Méliès taught us: The impossible becomes possible when you stop time and rearrange reality."*

#### 3. Segundo de Chomón: The Spanish Innovator (15 min)

**Historical Context:**
- Segundo de Chomón (1871-1929): Spanish filmmaker, often overshadowed by Méliès
- Worked for Pathé Frères in France
- Pioneered color film processes and advanced trick photography
- Influenced surrealist filmmakers (Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dalí)

**Key Films to Screen:**

**"El Hotel Eléctrico" (The Electric Hotel, 1908) - 8 minutes**
- Couple arrives at automated hotel
- Luggage unpacks itself, furniture moves, chaos ensues
- Advanced stop-motion animation
- Precursor to modern automation anxieties

**Screening Strategy:**
- Show full film (only 8 min) or key sequences:
  1. Arrival and luggage animation (0:00-3:00)
  2. Automated room chaos (3:00-6:00)
  3. Resolution (6:00-8:00)

**Techniques to Identify:**

1. **Advanced Stop-Motion:**
   - Smoother than Méliès (more frames per movement)
   - Complex choreography of multiple objects
   - Anticipates modern animation

2. **Hand-Coloring Mastery:**
   - More sophisticated than Méliès
   - Developed stencil processes for efficiency
   - Vibrant, surreal color palettes

3. **Optical Illusions:**
   - Forced perspective
   - Miniatures and scale tricks
   - Mirror effects

4. **Narrative Complexity:**
   - More story-driven than Méliès' spectacle
   - Social commentary (technology, modernity)
   - Surreal humor

**Why Chomón Matters:**
- Often called "the father of Spanish cinema"
- Influenced avant-garde and surrealist movements
- Demonstrated that technical innovation serves storytelling

**Discussion:** "How does Chomón build on Méliès' techniques? What's new here?"

**Connection to Advertising:**
- Surreal advertising (unexpected juxtapositions)
- Product animation (cereal pieces dancing, cars transforming)
- The "magical product" trope (cleaning products that work by magic)
- Humor through impossible situations

> *"Chomón showed us: When reality is not enough, create a new reality—but make it mean something."*

### Comparative Analysis (20 minutes)

**Create Comparison Chart (on board or slides):**

| Element | Lumière | Méliès | Chomón |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Approach** | Documentary realism | Theatrical spectacle | Surreal narrative |
| **Editing** | None (single shot) | In-camera tricks | Advanced stop-motion |
| **Goal** | Capture reality | Create wonder | Tell surreal stories |
| **Influence** | Documentary, realism | VFX, fantasy | Animation, surrealism |
| **Modern Ad Parallel** | Slice-of-life ads | Product transformation | Surreal/humorous ads |

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **"Which approach is most 'honest'? Which is most 'manipulative'?"**
   - Lumière seems objective but still frames reality
   - Méliès openly creates fantasy
   - Chomón uses fantasy to comment on reality

2. **"How did technical limitations inspire creativity?"**
   - No post-editing → must plan everything
   - Short film lengths → economy of storytelling
   - No sound → visual clarity essential

3. **"What can modern editors learn from these pioneers?"**
   - **Planning is everything:** Storyboard complex sequences
   - **Constraints breed creativity:** Limitations force innovation
   - **Visual clarity:** Story should be understandable without sound
   - **Surprise and delight:** Audiences love the unexpected

**Key Takeaway:**
"Editing didn't begin with cutting film in post-production. It began with PLANNING what to shoot and how to shoot it. The edit happens in your mind before it happens on the timeline."

> *"The master editor plans the impossible, then makes it look inevitable."*

### Assignment for Session B (10 minutes)

**Homework (to be completed before Session B):**

1. **Storyboard an In-Camera Trick (Required):**
   - Plan a simple "magic" effect (object appearing/disappearing, transformation, animation)
   - Create 6-panel storyboard showing:
     - Setup (what we see initially)
     - The "trick" moment
     - Reveal (the magical result)
   - Note: You'll film this in Session B

2. **Inspiration Research:**
   - Watch one modern stop-motion ad (links provided):
     - Honda "Paper" commercial (2015)
     - California Raisins commercials (1980s)
     - Wallace & Gromit ads
   - Note techniques used

3. **Reading (Optional but Recommended):**
   - "The Bizarre Marvels of Segundo de Chomón" (JSTOR article, provided)
   - Méliès biography excerpt (provided)

**Materials to Bring to Session B:**
- Phone or camera
- Small objects for stop-motion (toys, office supplies, etc.)
- Creativity and patience!

---

## Session B: In-Camera Magic – Recreating Early Effects (2 hours)

### Opening (10 minutes)

> *"You are about to become Méliès. You will stop time, move objects with your mind, and create the impossible. Welcome to the magic."*

**Storyboard Share:**
- Quick popcorn round: "What trick are you planning?"
- Show 2-3 interesting storyboards to class
- Emphasize: "The planning you did is 80% of the work"

**Today's Challenge:**
"You'll create a short 'trick film' using in-camera techniques and Premiere Pro. You'll learn that editing isn't just about cutting—it's about creating illusions."

---

### Technical Workshop: Stop-Motion & Substitution Cuts (30 minutes)

#### Demonstration: Creating a Substitution Cut

**Instructor demonstrates live:**

**Setup:**
- Place object (e.g., coffee cup) on table
- Frame shot with phone/camera on tripod (or stable surface)
- **Critical:** Camera MUST NOT MOVE

**Technique 1: Substitution Cut (Méliès Style)**

1. **Shot 1:** Film object for 3 seconds (cup on table)
2. **Stop camera** (do NOT move camera position)
3. **Remove object** (take cup away)
4. **Resume filming** for 3 seconds (empty table)

**In Premiere Pro:**
- Import both clips
- Place on timeline sequentially
- The "edit" is invisible—cup vanishes!

**Technique 2: Stop-Motion Animation**

1. **Frame 1:** Object in position A
2. **Take photo**
3. **Move object slightly** to position B
4. **Take photo**
5. **Repeat** 20-30 times for smooth motion

**In Premiere Pro:**
- Import all photos
- Set duration to 0.1 seconds each (10 frames per second)
- Photos play in sequence = animation!

**Pro Tip:** More photos = smoother motion. Méliès used fewer frames (jerky), Chomón used more (smoother).

#### Adobe Premiere Pro Techniques for Stop-Motion

**1. Importing Image Sequences:**
```
File > Import
Check "Image Sequence" box
Select first image in folder
Premiere imports all as video clip
```

**2. Adjusting Frame Duration:**
```
Right-click image sequence on timeline
Speed/Duration
Set to desired speed (slower = smoother)
```

**3. Frame-by-Frame Navigation:**
```
Arrow keys: Move one frame forward/back
Shift+Arrow: Move 5 frames
Page Up/Down: Move to edit points
```

**4. Precise Cutting:**
```
Zoom in timeline (+ key or scroll)
Use Razor tool (C) at exact frame
Or Cmd+K to cut at playhead
Frame accuracy is critical for invisible edits
```

**5. Speed Ramping (Advanced):**
```
Right-click clip > Show Clip Keyframes > Time Remapping > Speed
Add keyframes to vary speed
Slow-motion for emphasis, speed-up for comedy
```

### Practical Exercise: Create Your Trick Film (60 minutes)

#### Exercise Overview

**Objective:** Create a 15-30 second "trick film" using in-camera techniques and Premiere Pro editing.

**Options (Choose One):**

**Option 1: Substitution Cut (Méliès Style)**
- Object appears/disappears
- Person transforms into another person
- Object transforms into different object
- Example: Pen becomes flower, student becomes instructor

**Option 2: Stop-Motion Animation (Chomón Style)**
- Object moves on its own
- Multiple objects choreographed
- Transformation through gradual change
- Example: Office supplies organize themselves, toy car drives across desk

**Option 3: Hybrid (Advanced)**
- Combine substitution cuts with stop-motion
- Multiple effects in sequence
- Mini-narrative with magical elements
- Example: Book opens (stop-motion), pages turn, character appears (substitution)

#### Production Phase (30 minutes)

**Setup Stations:**
- Divide class into groups of 2-3
- Each group gets filming space (desk, corner, wall)
- Ensure stable camera positions (tripods, phone stands, or stacks of books)

**Filming Tips (Demonstrate):**

1. **Lock Your Camera:**
   - Use tripod or stable surface
   - Mark camera position with tape
   - If camera moves, effect fails!

2. **Consistent Lighting:**
   - Don't film near windows (light changes)
   - Use room lights consistently
   - Shadows reveal the trick if inconsistent

3. **Plan Your Movements:**
   - For stop-motion: Small, incremental movements
   - For substitution: Mark object positions with tape
   - Test a few frames first

4. **Shoot More Than You Need:**
   - Extra frames = options in editing
   - Can always cut, can't add what you didn't shoot

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Camera movement (ruins illusion)
- Inconsistent lighting (visible in edit)
- Too few frames (jerky motion)
- Forgetting to mark positions (continuity errors)

**Instructor Role:**
- Circulate between groups
- Troubleshoot technical issues
- Encourage experimentation
- Celebrate creative ideas

> *"In stop-motion, patience is not a virtue—it is the only virtue. One frame at a time, magic emerges."*

#### Editing Phase (25 minutes)

**Import and Assemble:**

1. **Transfer footage to computers**
   - AirDrop, USB, cloud upload
   - Import into Premiere Pro

2. **Create sequence**
   - Right-click footage > New Sequence from Clip
   - Or manually: 1920x1080, 24fps

3. **Assemble shots**
   - For substitution cuts: Place clips sequentially, trim to exact frame where change happens
   - For stop-motion: Import as image sequence, adjust duration

4. **Fine-tune timing**
   - Frame-by-frame navigation
   - Ensure cuts are invisible (no flash frames)
   - Adjust speed if needed

5. **Add title cards (Optional but encouraged)**
   - Méliès-style title: "The Vanishing Pen" or "The Magical Desk"
   - Use Graphics > New Item > Legacy Title
   - Old-fashioned font (serif, ornate)

6. **Export**
   - H.264, YouTube 1080p preset
   - Name: `LastName_Week02_TrickFilm.mp4`

**Advanced Techniques (For Fast Finishers):**

**Hand-Coloring Effect:**
- Use Lumetri Color > Creative > Look > Desaturate
- Add colored shapes over specific elements (mimicking hand-painting)
- Keyframe opacity for flickering vintage effect

**Film Grain & Scratches:**
- Add Adjustment Layer
- Effects > Noise & Grain > Noise
- Effects > Generate > Lens Flare (for light leaks)
- Reduce frame rate to 12fps for jerky vintage look

**Vignette (Dark Edges):**
- Lumetri Color > Vignette
- Darken edges for old film look

---

### Screening & Critique (15 minutes)

**Format:**
- Screen all student trick films (15-30 seconds each)
- Class of 20 = ~10 minutes of screening
- Brief applause after each

**Critique Discussion (5 minutes):**

**Guiding Questions:**
- "Which effects were most convincing? Why?"
- "Where did you notice the 'trick'? What gave it away?"
- "What was challenging about in-camera editing?"
- "How does this compare to modern VFX?"

**Key Insights to Draw Out:**
- **Planning is essential:** Those who storyboarded well had smoother shoots
- **Patience pays off:** Stop-motion requires meticulous attention
- **Constraints inspire creativity:** Limited tools = creative solutions
- **The 'edit' happens before the cut:** In-camera work is pre-editing

> *"You have now touched the origins of cinema. You have stopped time. You have created magic from nothing but light, patience, and imagination."*

## Community Best Practices: Stop-Motion & VFX

### From Professional Animators & VFX Artists

**1. "Animate in Layers"**
- Separate foreground, midground, background
- Easier to control and adjust
- Creates depth

**2. "Onion Skinning" (Reference Previous Frame)**
- In stop-motion apps: See ghost of previous frame
- Ensures smooth motion
- Premiere doesn't have built-in, but you can:
  - Duplicate previous frame on track above
  - Lower opacity to 30%
  - Use as reference for next position

**3. "The 12 Principles of Animation" (Disney)**
Even for simple stop-motion, key principles apply:
- **Squash and Stretch:** Exaggerate for life
- **Anticipation:** Wind up before action
- **Staging:** Clear silhouettes and composition
- **Ease In/Out:** Slow start, slow end (not linear motion)

**4. "Test Early, Test Often"**
- Shoot 10 frames, review
- Adjust before committing to 100 frames
- Saves time and frustration

**5. "Lighting Consistency is Everything"**
- Use artificial light (not windows)
- Mark light positions
- Shoot in one session if possible (sun changes)

### Modern Stop-Motion Advertising Examples

**Honda "Paper" (2015):**
- Entire Honda history told through paper cutouts
- 2 minutes of pure stop-motion
- Thousands of hand-cut pieces
- Message: Innovation through craftsmanship

**California Raisins (1986-1994):**
- Claymation characters
- Sold raisins through personality and music
- Became cultural phenomenon

**Chipotle "Back to the Start" (2011):**
- Stop-motion animation
- Critiques factory farming
- Emotional storytelling for fast food brand

**Discussion:** "Why do brands still use stop-motion in the digital age?"
- **Authenticity:** Handmade = human touch
- **Nostalgia:** Evokes childhood, warmth
- **Differentiation:** Stands out from CGI
- **Craft:** Demonstrates brand values (care, quality)

---

## Theory Integration: Early Cinema & Modern Advertising

### Key Connections

**1. Visual Spectacle Sells**
- Méliès knew: Audiences pay for wonder
- Modern ads: Spectacle captures attention
- Example: Super Bowl ads prioritize visual wow-factor

**2. The "Magical Product" Trope**
- Méliès: Transformations and impossibilities
- Modern ads: Products that magically solve problems
- Cleaning products, beauty products, tech products—all use "magic"

**3. Planning = Success**
- Early filmmakers had ONE TAKE (film was expensive)
- Modern lesson: Storyboard complex sequences
- "Measure twice, cut once" applies to editing

**4. Constraints Breed Innovation**
- No post-editing → in-camera creativity
- No sound → visual clarity
- Short lengths → economy of storytelling
- Modern application: Platform constraints (TikTok 60s, YouTube bumper 6s) inspire creativity

**5. The Edit Begins in Pre-Production**
- Méliès and Chomón planned every frame
- Modern editors: Shot lists, storyboards, animatics
- "The battle is won before the first shot is fired"

> *"Méliès and Chomón teach us: The impossible is simply the possible that has not yet been planned."*
