## Context & Learning Goals

### Historical Foundation
- **Marshall McLuhan's "The Medium is the Message" (1964):** The form of media influences its impact on the audience, often as much as content does
- **Guy Debord's Society of the Spectacle (1967):** News, propaganda, advertising, and entertainment blend into an all-encompassing spectacle that shapes reality
- **Jean Kilbourne's critique:** Advertising sells not just products but concepts of love, beauty, success, sexuality, and normalcy

### Technical Skills to Introduce
- Adobe Premiere Pro workspace navigation and interface
- Basic timeline editing and three-point editing
- Import/export fundamentals
- Essential keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
- Project organization and folder structure

### Critical Thinking Objectives
- How does editing make messages persuasive?
- Ethics of manipulation vs. persuasion
- Platform-specific considerations (TV vs. YouTube vs. TikTok)
- Unconscious influence of editing choices on viewers

### Week 1 Success Indicators
By the end of Week 1, students should be able to:
- Navigate Premiere Pro interface confidently
- Import media and create sequences
- Make basic cuts and understand pacing impact
- Articulate how editing serves persuasion
- Reference McLuhan and Debord in discussions
- Identify platform-specific editing considerations

- Overview of syllabus: 10 weeks, 3 major projects, portfolio-worthy final piece
- Assessment structure: Analysis (25%), Team Videothon (25%), Final Project (50%)
- Tools required: Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, access to camera/phone

**Central Question:** "What makes editing persuasive?"
- Open discussion: What ads do students remember? Why?
- Collect responses on board: humor, emotion, surprise, repetition, music, pacing
- Transition: "Today we'll explore how the *form* of editing itself persuades, beyond content"

### Core Lecture: Theory (45 minutes)

#### 1. Marshall McLuhan: "The Medium is the Message" (15 min)

{% include video-player.html
   platform="youtube"
   id="vTSmbMm7MDg"
   title="Marshall McLuhan - The Medium is the Message"
   timestamps="0:00|Introduction,2:00|Argument Starts to Camera,12:27|McLuhan Appears" %}

**Key Thesis:**
The form of media influences how content is received, often more than the content itself.

**Examples to Present:**
- **Same message, different media:**
  - News story on newspaper (linear, reader-paced, text-heavy)
  - Same story on TV (visual, editor-paced, emotional music)
  - Same story on TikTok (vertical, 60 seconds, text overlays, trending sound)

**Discussion prompt:** "How does the *platform* change how you feel about the information?"

**Application to Advertising:**
- A 30-second TV spot (high production, sound-on, captive audience during commercial break)
- A 15-second TikTok ad (vertical, must hook in 2 seconds, sound-optional, infinite scroll competition)
- The *editing approach* must change based on medium

**Quote to emphasize:**

<figure class="quote">
<blockquote>
The medium shapes the message. The editor shapes both.

</figcaption>
</figure>

**Key Thesis:**
In modern consumer society, direct experience is replaced by representations and images. "News, propaganda, advertising, entertainment" merge into a unified spectacle.

**Debord's Thesis 6 (paraphrased):**
The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relationship mediated by images. Advertising is a core component of this spectacle.

**Examples to Present:**
- How advertising creates "lifestyle images" we aspire to rather than showing actual products
- Instagram influencer culture: life as curated spectacle
- Super Bowl commercials: entertainment that IS advertising

**Discussion prompt:** "Are we passive consumers of the spectacle, or can we be critical creators?"

**Application to Editing:**
- Editors construct the spectacle through shot selection, pacing, music
- Every cut is a choice about what reality to present
- Responsibility: Are we manipulating or informing?

#### 3. Jean Kilbourne: Advertising's Unconscious Influence (15 min)

**Key Thesis:**
"Advertising sells more than products—it sells concepts of love, beauty, success, sexuality, and normalcy."

{% include video-player.html

   id="jWKXit_3rpQ"
   title="Killing Us Softly 4 - Trailer [Featuring Jean Kilbourne]"
   timestamps="0:00|Introduction,0:30|Key Concepts,1:00|Media Analysis" %}

**Resources:**
- [Jean Kilbourne's Films](https://jeankilbourne.com/films/) - Complete collection of her documentary work including *Killing Us Softly* series

**Examples to Present:**
- Beauty product ads: Selling insecurity, then solution
- Car commercials: Selling freedom, masculinity, status (not transportation)
- Fast food ads: Selling happiness, family togetherness (not nutrition)

**The Kuleshov Effect Preview:**
- Mention that we'll study this deeply in Week 4
- Quick explanation: Same face + different images = audience imagines different emotions
- **Advertising application:** Product shot + happy people = product inherits happiness through juxtaposition

**Discussion prompt:** "Can you think of an ad that influenced you without you realizing it?"

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Stereotyping (gender roles, racial representation)
- Manipulation of insecurities
- Creating false needs
- Addictive design patterns (infinite scroll, autoplay)

### Screening & Analysis (45 minutes)

#### Example 1: Apple "1984" Super Bowl Commercial (60 seconds)

**Context:** Aired during 1984 Super Bowl, directed by Ridley Scott, introducing Macintosh computer

{% include video-player.html
   platform="youtube"
   id="ErwS24cBZPc"
   title="Apple 1984 Super Bowl Commercial"
   timestamps="0:00|Opening - Dystopian World,0:30|Heroine Appears,0:50|Chase Sequence,1:00|Hammer Throw & Explosion" %}

**Screening:** Play twice
- First viewing: Just watch and feel
- Second viewing: Analyze editing choices

**Analysis Points:**
- **Opening:** Dystopian gray world, marching workers (sets mood immediately)
- **Pacing:** Slow build with rhythmic cuts matching footsteps
- **Montage:** Intercutting between Big Brother screen and running heroine
- **Climax:** Rapid cuts as she throws hammer, slow-motion explosion
- **Resolution:** Simple text reveal of product
- **Duration:** Tells complete story in 60 seconds

**Editing Techniques:**
- Continuity editing for clarity (we follow heroine's journey)
- Montage for tension (cutting between threat and hero)
- Slow-motion for emphasis (explosion moment)
- Color grading (gray dystopia vs. colorful athlete)

**Persuasive Strategy:**
- Positions Apple as rebel against conformity (IBM = Big Brother)
- Emotional appeal: freedom, individuality, revolution
- Minimal product focus (only text at end) – selling ideology

**Discussion:** "How does the editing make you *feel* about the product before you even see it?"

#### Example 2: Modern TikTok Viral Ad (15-30 seconds)

**Context:** Choose a recent viral TikTok ad (e.g., Duolingo, Ryanair, or creator-brand partnership)

**Screening:** Play 2-3 times

**Analysis Points:**
- **Hook:** First 2 seconds must stop the scroll (movement, text, surprise)
- **Format:** Vertical (9:16), fills phone screen
- **Pacing:** Extremely fast cuts (1-2 seconds per shot)
- **Text overlays:** Assumes sound might be off
- **Loop potential:** End connects to beginning for replay
- **Trend integration:** Uses popular sounds or meme formats

**Editing Techniques:**
- Jump cuts (no smooth transitions, pure energy)
- Text animations synced to beats
- Fast montage of product benefits
- Call-to-action in last frame

**Persuasive Strategy:**
- Entertainment first, advertising second (doesn't feel like ad)
- Authenticity over polish (relatable, not corporate)
- Engagement bait (encourages comments, shares)

**Discussion:** "How is this different from the Apple ad? What does the platform demand?"

#### Comparison Exercise (Group Discussion)

Create comparison chart on board:

| Element | TV (Apple 1984) | TikTok (Modern) |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Duration | 60 seconds | 15-30 seconds |
| Orientation | Horizontal | Vertical |
| Pacing | Builds slowly | Hooks immediately |
| Sound | Essential | Optional |
| Style | Cinematic | Authentic/Raw |
| Goal | Brand ideology | Engagement/Virality |

**Key Insight:** The *medium* (TV vs. TikTok) dictates the *editing approach*. McLuhan was right!

---

### Discussion Questions (15 minutes)

**Facilitate conversation around:**

1. **"Are we immune to advertising manipulation?"**
   - Most students will say "yes" initially
   - Challenge: "Then why do you remember certain ads? Why do brands spend billions?"
   - Introduce concept of unconscious influence

2. **"How does editing shape our perception unconsciously?"**
   - Pacing affects emotion (fast = excitement, slow = contemplation)
   - Music cues emotional response
   - Shot selection frames reality (what's shown vs. hidden)
   - Juxtaposition creates associations

3. **"What ethical responsibilities do editors have?"**
   - Truthfulness in representation
   - Avoiding harmful stereotypes
   - Transparency about manipulation
   - Considering societal impact

**Wrap-up:**
- Editing is never neutral—every cut is a choice
- As future editors, you have power and responsibility
- This course will teach technique AND ethics

### Video Analysis: Editing Techniques in Practice (15 minutes)

{% include video-player.html platform="vimeo" id="180668935" title="Editing Techniques Demonstration" %}

**Critical Thinking Prompts:**

After watching the video, discuss these questions:

1. **Editing as Persuasion:**
   - How do the editing choices in this video influence your emotional response?
   - What specific cuts or transitions create meaning beyond what the footage alone shows?
   - How does the editor guide your attention and interpretation?

2. **Technical Choices:**
   - Identify at least three different editing techniques used (refer to the [NYFA Film Editing Vocabulary Guide](https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/a-beginners-guide-to-film-editing-vocabulary/))
   - Why might the editor have chosen these specific techniques?
   - How do these techniques serve the video's purpose or message?

3. **Ethical Considerations:**
   - Does this video manipulate or inform? Where is the line?
   - What reality is being constructed through editing choices?
   - How might different editing choices change the meaning or impact?

**Technical Analysis Guide:**

Use the following framework to analyze the editing techniques, referencing [NYFA's Film Editing Vocabulary](https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/a-beginners-guide-to-film-editing-vocabulary/):

**1. Identify Editing Techniques:**
- **Cuts:** Where are straight cuts used? Are there any jump cuts?
- **Transitions:** Are there dissolves, fades, or wipes? Why were they chosen?
- **Continuity:** Is continuity editing maintained? Are there any continuity errors?
- **Pacing:** How does the rhythm of cuts affect the emotional impact?
- **Montage:** Are there montage sequences? What do they convey?

**2. Analyze Shot Relationships:**
- **Establishing Shots:** How is space/time established?
- **Shot Reverse Shot:** Are conversations or interactions edited this way?
- **Eyeline Match:** How does the editor guide viewer attention?
- **Matched Cuts:** Are there cuts that match composition or action?

**3. Audio-Visual Relationships:**
- **J-Cuts:** Does audio lead into the next shot?
- **L-Cuts:** Does audio continue from the previous shot?
- **Sweetening:** How is music and sound used to enhance meaning?

**4. Narrative Structure:**
- **Cross Cutting:** Are there parallel storylines?
- **Cutaways:** Are there interruptions to show related action?
- **Sequence Shots:** Are there long takes? Why might they be used?

**Discussion Format:**
- Watch the video once for overall impression
- Watch a second time focusing on specific editing techniques
- Use the vocabulary guide to name techniques precisely
- Connect technical choices to emotional/meaningful impact

**Launch Premiere Pro and create new project together**

**Four Main Panels:**

1. **Project Panel (Top Left):**
   - Where all media lives (footage, audio, graphics)
   - Organization: Create bins (folders) for structure
   - **Best Practice:** Create bins: RAW_FOOTAGE, AUDIO, GRAPHICS, SEQUENCES, EXPORTS

2. **Source Monitor (Middle Left):**
   - Preview clips before adding to timeline
   - Set In/Out points to select portions
   - **Keyboard shortcuts:** `I` (In point), `O` (Out point)

3. **Timeline (Bottom):**
   - Where you assemble your edit
   - Video tracks (V1, V2, V3...) stack vertically
   - Audio tracks (A1, A2, A3...) below
   - **Playhead:** Red line showing current frame

4. **Program Monitor (Middle Right):**
   - Preview your edited sequence
   - What the final video looks like
   - Export from here

**Demonstrate:**
- Import media (File > Import or drag-and-drop)
- Create sequence (Right-click footage > New Sequence from Clip)
- Add clip to timeline (drag or use Insert/Overwrite)
- Play/pause (Spacebar)
- Scrub timeline (drag playhead)

#### Part 2: Essential Keyboard Shortcuts (10 minutes)

**The Essential 10 (write on board, have students practice):**

```
PLAYBACK:
Space       - Play/Pause
J K L       - Reverse / Stop / Forward (tap multiple times for speed)

EDITING:
I / O       - Set In/Out points
C           - Razor tool (cut clip)
V           - Selection tool (default)
Cmd+K       - Cut at playhead

TIMELINE:

#### Part 3: Three-Point Editing Workflow (20 minutes)

**Professional editors use "three-point editing" for precision:**

**The Three Points:**
1. In point in Source monitor (where clip starts)
2. Out point in Source monitor (where clip ends)
3. In point on Timeline (where it goes)

**Two Ways to Add Clips:**
- **Insert (`,` comma key):** Pushes existing clips forward
- **Overwrite (`.` period key):** Replaces existing clips

**Demonstrate workflow:**
1. Open clip in Source monitor
2. Play through, mark In (`I`) where you want it to start
3. Mark Out (`O`) where you want it to end
4. Click on Timeline where you want it to go
5. Press `.` to Overwrite (or `,` to Insert)

**Why this matters:**
- Faster than dragging clips
- More precise
- Industry standard workflow
- Keeps hands on keyboard

**Student practice (10 minutes):**
- Provide 5 short clips
- Use three-point editing to assemble them in sequence
- Experiment with Insert vs. Overwrite

### Exercise: "Abstract Rhythm" (50 minutes)

*Use this exercise when raw camera footage is not available. Students create an abstract visual piece using only solid colors, shapes, and sound.*

#### Exercise Overview

**Objective:** Understand the fundamental relationship between visual rhythm, pacing, and sound without the distraction of narrative content. Focus purely on timing, cuts, and audio-visual synchronization.

**Why This Works:**
- No footage needed—create everything from scratch in Premiere Pro
- Forces focus on editing fundamentals: timing, rhythm, transitions
- Demonstrates how cuts alone create meaning and emotion
- Introduces split-screen composition techniques

#### Free Educational Resources

**Color Palette Inspiration:**
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co) — Color scheme generator
- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com) — Color wheel and palettes

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Choose Your Soundtrack (5 minutes)**

1. Go to [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org) or [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/)
2. Find a short music track (30-60 seconds) with clear rhythm
3. Download the track
4. **Listen carefully:** Identify the beats, measures, and emotional peaks

**Suggested search terms:** "electronic beat," "ambient rhythm," "percussion loop," "minimal techno"

**Step 2: Create Your Project (5 minutes)**

1. Create new Premiere Pro project: `Abstract_Rhythm_[YourName]`
2. Create bins: `AUDIO`, `GRAPHICS`, `SEQUENCES`, `EXPORTS`
3. Import your soundtrack into `AUDIO` bin
4. Create new sequence: **1920x1080, 24fps** (or match your audio)

**Step 3: Create Solid Color Layers (10 minutes)**

In Premiere Pro, create solid color graphics:

1. **File > New > Color Matte**
2. Choose a color (start with 5-6 contrasting colors)
3. Name it: `RED_SOLID`, `BLUE_SOLID`, etc.
4. Repeat for each color

**Color Palette Suggestions:**
- **High Energy:** Red, Orange, Yellow, White, Black
- **Cool/Calm:** Blue, Cyan, Purple, White, Black
- **Earth Tones:** Brown, Green, Cream, Black, Rust
- **Monochrome:** 5 shades of gray from white to black

**Step 4: Build Your Timeline (15 minutes)**

1. Drag your soundtrack to A1 (audio track 1)
2. Listen to the track and mark key moments with markers (`M` key):
   - Beat drops
   - Transitions
   - Emotional peaks
   - Quiet moments

3. **Create visual rhythm by placing color mattes:**
   - Cut on the beat (use `Cmd+K` to cut at playhead)
   - Vary clip lengths: 1 frame, 4 frames, 1 second, 2 seconds
   - Create patterns: A-B-A-B, A-B-C-A-B-C

4. **Experiment with:**
   - **Flash cuts:** 1-4 frames of contrasting color
   - **Sustained holds:** 2-4 seconds of one color
   - **Gradual transitions:** Use cross-dissolves between colors
   - **Hard cuts:** Instant color changes on beats

**Step 5: Add Split-Screen Composition (10 minutes)**

1. Stack two color mattes on V1 and V2
2. Select the top layer (V2)
3. In **Effect Controls**, adjust:
   - **Scale:** 50%
   - **Position:** Move to left or right side

4. **Create split-screen patterns:**
   - Vertical split (left/right)
   - Horizontal split (top/bottom)
   - Quadrants (4 colors)
   - Asymmetric splits (1/3 - 2/3)

5. **Animate the splits:**
   - Use keyframes to change position over time
   - Create wipes using position animation
   - Stack multiple layers for complex compositions

**Step 6: Refine and Polish (5 minutes)**

1. Watch your piece from start to finish
2. Adjust cuts that feel "off" from the beat
3. Add variety: Don't repeat the same pattern too many times
4. Consider adding:
   - **Fade in** at the beginning
   - **Fade to black** at the end
   - **Opacity changes** for layering effects

#### Analysis Questions (Group Discussion)

After completing the exercise, discuss:

1. **Rhythm & Timing:**
   - How did the music guide your editing decisions?
   - What happens when cuts are ON the beat vs. OFF the beat?
   - How does cut length affect perceived energy?

2. **Color & Emotion:**
   - What emotions did different colors evoke?
   - How did color transitions (hard cut vs. dissolve) change the feeling?
   - Did certain colors work better with certain parts of the music?

3. **Connection to Advertising:**
   - How do commercials use rhythm and color to persuade?
   - Think of a car commercial: fast cuts = excitement, slow cuts = luxury
   - How might this abstract exercise inform narrative editing?

4. **Technical Vocabulary (Reference [NYFA's Film Editing Terms](https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/a-beginners-guide-to-film-editing-vocabulary/)):**
   - **Cut:** Instant transition between colors
   - **Dissolve:** Gradual blend between colors
   - **Montage:** Sequence of images creating meaning through juxtaposition
   - **Pacing:** The rhythm and speed of your cuts
   - **Sweetening:** How the music enhances the visual impact

#### Export Your Work

1. **File > Export > Media** (or `Cmd+M`)
2. Format: **H.264**
3. Preset: **Match Source - High Bitrate**
4. Output Name: `Abstract_Rhythm_[YourName]_v01.mp4`
5. Export

#### Bonus Challenge: Emotional Contrast

Create TWO versions of your abstract piece using the **same soundtrack**:

**Version A: Aggressive/Energetic**
- Fast cuts (1-4 frames)
- High contrast colors (red, black, white)
- Cuts on every beat
- Hard cuts only

**Version B: Calm/Meditative**
- Slow transitions (1-2 second dissolves)
- Soft colors (pastels, earth tones)
- Cuts on every 4th beat
- Mostly dissolves

**Compare:** How does the same music feel completely different with different editing choices?

### Community Best Practices (Integrated Throughout)

**From Professional Editors:**

1. **"Edit with your ears first"**
   - Audio continuity guides visual cuts
   - If audio sounds smooth, visual cut will feel smooth
   - Listen for natural pauses to place cuts

2. **"Cut on movement"**
   - Motion masks the transition
   - Cut when character gestures, turns head, stands up
   - Eye won't notice the cut during movement

3. **"When in doubt, cut it out"**
   - Tighten for impact
   - Every frame should serve the story
   - If a shot doesn't add value, remove it

4. **"Save versions"**
   - Duplicate sequences before major changes
   - Name clearly: v01, v02, v03
   - Never lose your work to experimentation

**Project Organization Best Practices:**

```

### Group Critique (10 minutes)

**Format:**
- Screen 3-4 student examples (volunteers or instructor selects)
- Play slow version, then fast version
- Class discusses differences

**Guiding Questions:**
- "How did the pacing affect your emotional response?"
- "Which version felt more appropriate for a dramatic scene? For an action scene?"
- "What specific editing choices created the different feelings?"
- "Where did you notice cuts in the fast version? Where did you NOT notice cuts in the slow version?"

**Key Takeaways to Emphasize:**
- Pacing is a powerful tool for emotional manipulation (neutral term)
- Same footage can tell different stories through editing alone
- Continuity editing can be slow OR fast
- The editor controls time and therefore emotion

## Theory Integration Points

### Concepts to Emphasize Throughout Week 1

#### 1. Editing as Rhetoric
- Every cut is an argument
- Sequence creates meaning (what comes first shapes what comes next)
- Omission is as powerful as inclusion (what you DON'T show matters)
- The editor is making thousands of micro-arguments

#### 2. Platform Awareness
Understanding how distribution channel shapes editing approach:

**Television (Traditional):**
- 30-second spots, horizontal 16:9
- Sound-on (viewers expect audio)
- Captive audience during commercial break
- High production value expected
- Can build slowly (first 5 seconds less critical)

**YouTube:**
- 6-60 seconds (skippable after 5 seconds)
- Horizontal, but also square for mobile
- Must hook in first 5 seconds or lose viewer
- Thumbnail + title critical for click
- Longer form acceptable if engaging

**TikTok:**
- 15-60 seconds optimal
- Vertical 9:16 (fills phone screen)
- Sound-optional (captions essential)
- Hook in first 2 seconds (stop the scroll)
- Loop-friendly (end connects to beginning)
- Trend integration (sounds, formats, memes)

**Instagram:**
- Feed: Square 1:1 or portrait 4:5
- Stories: Vertical 9:16, 15 seconds per slide
- Reels: Vertical 9:16, 15-90 seconds
- Sound-optional (many browse muted)
- First frame is thumbnail (make it count)

#### 3. Ethical Considerations

**The Spectrum of Persuasion:**
- **Information:** Presenting facts clearly
- **Persuasion:** Making compelling argument
- **Manipulation:** Exploiting psychological vulnerabilities
- **Deception:** Presenting falsehoods

**Questions to Ask:**
- Am I being truthful in my representation?
- Am I reinforcing harmful stereotypes?
- Am I exploiting insecurities or fears?
- Would I be proud to show this to diverse audiences?
- Is my persuasion ethical or manipulative?

**Feminist Critique (Kilbourne):**
- Objectification of bodies (especially women)
- Unrealistic beauty standards
- Gender role stereotyping
- Sexual exploitation for product sales

**Anti-Consumerist Critique (Klein):**
- Creating false needs
- Branding as identity replacement
- Corporate co-opting of social movements
- Environmental impact of consumption

## Technical Deep-Dive: Adobe Premiere Pro Fundamentals

### 1. Project Setup Best Practices

**Sequence Settings (Choose based on source footage):**

```
CINEMATIC (Film-like):
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- Frame Rate: 23.976 fps
- Pixel Aspect Ratio: Square
- Audio: 48kHz, 16-bit

BROADCAST (TV/Professional):
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- Frame Rate: 29.97 fps
- Pixel Aspect Ratio: Square
- Audio: 48kHz, 16-bit

SOCIAL MEDIA VERTICAL:
- Resolution: 1080x1920 (9:16)
- Frame Rate: 30 fps
- Pixel Aspect Ratio: Square
- Audio: 48kHz, 16-bit

4K (High-end):
- Resolution: 3840x2160
- Frame Rate: 23.976 or 29.97 fps
- Pixel Aspect Ratio: Square
- Audio: 48kHz, 24-bit
```

**Pro Tip:** Use "New Sequence from Clip" to automatically match source footage settings

### 2. Import Strategies

**Method 1: Media Browser**
- Advantage: Preview clips before importing
- Navigate to folder in Media Browser panel
- Scrub through clips to see content
- Import only what you need

**Method 2: Import Dialog (Cmd+I)**
- Advantage: Batch import entire folders
- Can import sequences, projects, images, audio
- Faster for large amounts of media

**Ingest Options:**
- **Copy to project location:** Safer (all media in one place), uses more storage
- **Link to original:** Saves space, but risky if original files move
- **Create proxies on import:** For 4K footage, create lower-res editing copies

### 3. Workspace Customization

**Recommended Workspaces:**
- **Editing:** Default, good for most work
- **Color:** For color grading (Lumetri panel prominent)
- **Audio:** For sound mixing (Essential Sound panel)
- **Graphics:** For titles and motion graphics

**Customize your own:**
- Drag panels to resize
- Save workspace: Window > Workspaces > Save as New Workspace
- Reset if things get messy: Window > Workspaces > Reset to Saved Layout

### 4. Essential Effects & Transitions

**The 99% Rule: Use Straight Cuts**

Most professional editing uses simple cuts. Transitions should be rare and purposeful.

**When to Use Transitions:**

**Cross Dissolve:**
- Time passage ("Later that day...")
- Dreamy/romantic mood
- Softening harsh cut
- Montage sequences

**Dip to Black/White:**
- Chapter breaks
- Dramatic pause
- End of sequence
- Death/serious moment

**AVOID:**
- Star wipes, page peels, fancy effects
- These scream "amateur" in professional work
- Exception: Intentional retro/campy style

<figure class="quote">
<blockquote>
The best transition is no transition—the cut that serves the story invisibly.
</blockquote>
<figcaption>
&mdash; Tao of the Video Editor
</figcaption>
</figure>

**Audio Transitions:**
- **Constant Power Crossfade:** Default, good for most
- **Exponential Fade:** Better for music fades
- **J-Cut:** Audio leads video (hear next scene before seeing it)
- **L-Cut:** Video leads audio (see next scene while hearing previous)

### 5. Playback Optimization

**If playback is choppy:**
1. Lower playback resolution (click wrench icon in Program monitor)
   - Set to 1/2 or 1/4 for smooth playback
   - Doesn't affect export quality
2. Render In to Out (`Enter` key)
   - Red line above timeline = needs rendering
   - Yellow = may need rendering
   - Green = rendered, smooth playback
3. Use proxy workflow for 4K footage
   - Create low-res copies for editing
   - Auto-switch to high-res on export

**Performance Tips:**
- Close other applications
- Clear media cache: Preferences > Media Cache > Clean
- Use SSD for media storage if possible
- Increase RAM allocation: Preferences > Memory

## Next Week Preview

**Week 2: Origins of Film Editing – From Lumière to Méliès**

We'll travel back to the birth of cinema (1890s-1900s) to see how editing emerged from necessity and imagination. Students will explore:
- Lumière Brothers' "actualities" (no edits, pure observation)
- Georges Méliès' trick films (in-camera magic)
- Segundo de Chomón's surreal innovations

**Hands-on:** Students will recreate early cinema effects using stop-motion and substitution cuts, learning that editing began as problem-solving and creative experimentation.
