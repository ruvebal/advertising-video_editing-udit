**Week 3:** Continuity editing - The invisible art
**Week 4:** Soviet montage - Kuleshov and the creation of meaning
**Week 5:** Breaking the rules - Godard to Tarantino
**Week 6:** Advertising structures - Storytelling in 30 seconds
**Week 7:** Team videothon - Creativity under pressure
**Week 8:** Post-production polish - Color, sound, effects
**Week 9:** Ethics and platforms - Responsibility in the attention economy
