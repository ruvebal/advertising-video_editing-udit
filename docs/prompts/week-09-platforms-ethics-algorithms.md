## Session A: The Attention Economy – Editing for Social Media (2 hours)

### Opening (10 minutes)

> *"We edit not in a vacuum, but in an ecosystem designed to capture and monetize attention. To edit ethically, we must understand the system."*

**Recap Week 8:**
- Post-production polish: color, sound, graphics
- Technical mastery achieved
- "Last week we learned HOW to edit professionally. This week we ask: SHOULD we? And for whom?"

**Today's Critical Question:**
"Social media platforms are designed to maximize engagement—to keep you scrolling, watching, clicking. As editors creating content for these platforms, are we complicit in addictive design? Or can we create responsibly within the system?"

**Demonstrate:**
- Open TikTok or Instagram
- Scroll for 30 seconds
- "Notice: You can't stop. The feed is infinite. The algorithm knows what you like. This is by design."

---

### Core Lecture: Platforms, Algorithms & Attention (50 minutes)

#### 1. Platform-Specific Editing Strategies (15 min)

**The Platform Dictates the Edit:**

**Television (Traditional Media):**
- **Format:** 16:9 horizontal, 1920x1080
- **Length:** 30 or 60 seconds (fixed slots)
- **Sound:** Essential (viewers expect audio)
- **Pacing:** Can build slowly (captive audience)
- **Editing Style:** Polished, high production value
- **Branding:** Clear at beginning and end
- **Audience:** Passive consumption, scheduled viewing

**YouTube:**
- **Format:** 16:9 horizontal, 1920x1080 or 4K
- **Length:** Variable (6s bumpers to long-form)
- **Hook:** First 5 seconds critical (skippable ads)
- **Sound:** Important but many watch muted
- **Thumbnail:** Critical for click-through
- **Editing Style:** Varies by content type
- **Algorithm:** Rewards watch time, engagement (likes, comments)
- **Audience:** Active seekers, searchable content

**TikTok:**
- **Format:** 9:16 vertical, 1080x1920
- **Length:** 15-60 seconds (sweet spot: 21-34s)
- **Hook:** First 2 seconds critical (stop the scroll)
- **Sound:** Trending audio boosts algorithm
- **Captions:** Essential (many watch muted)
- **Editing Style:** Fast-paced, native feel (not overly polished)
- **Loop:** End connects to beginning (encourages rewatch)
- **Algorithm:** Rewards completion rate, replays, engagement
- **Audience:** Infinite scroll, discovery-based

**Instagram Feed:**
- **Format:** 1:1 square or 4:5 portrait, 1080x1080 or 1080x1350
- **Length:** 15-60 seconds
- **Thumbnail:** First frame is preview
- **Sound:** Optional (many browse muted)
- **Captions:** Recommended
- **Editing Style:** Aesthetic, on-brand, polished
- **Algorithm:** Rewards saves, shares, time spent
- **Audience:** Curated feed, relationship-based

**Instagram Stories/Reels:**
- **Format:** 9:16 vertical, 1080x1920
- **Length:** 15s per story slide, up to 90s for Reels
- **Interactive:** Polls, questions, swipe-ups
- **Ephemeral:** Stories disappear in 24 hours
- **Editing Style:** Authentic, less polished okay
- **Algorithm:** Reels prioritized in feed
- **Audience:** Engaged followers, FOMO-driven

**Key Insight:**
"You cannot create one video and post it everywhere. Each platform demands specific optimization. The editor must be a chameleon."

> *"The platform is not neutral. The platform shapes the message as much as the message itself."*

#### 2. The Attention Economy and Addictive Design (20 min)

**What is the Attention Economy?**

**Definition:**
In the digital age, human attention is the scarce resource. Platforms compete to capture and monetize it.

**The Business Model:**
1. **Free platform** (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)
2. **Users create/consume content** (engagement)
3. **Platform sells attention to advertisers** (revenue)
4. **More engagement = more money**

**Therefore:** Platforms are incentivized to maximize time spent, not user wellbeing.

**Addictive Design Patterns:**

**1. Infinite Scroll**
- No natural stopping point
- "Just one more" becomes endless
- Exploits human curiosity and FOMO
- **Research:** "Design patterns like infinite scroll... work by hacking our neurochemistry"

**2. Autoplay**
- Next video starts automatically
- Reduces friction to continue watching
- Removes conscious choice
- **Example:** YouTube, Netflix, TikTok

**3. Variable Rewards (Slot Machine Effect)**
- Sometimes great content, sometimes mediocre
- Unpredictability keeps you checking
- Same psychology as gambling
- **Example:** Pull-to-refresh, notifications

**4. Social Validation**
- Likes, hearts, views as dopamine hits
- Creates feedback loop (post → check → post more)
- Exploits human need for belonging
- **Example:** Instagram likes, TikTok views

**5. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**
- Stories disappear in 24 hours
- "Everyone is watching this"
- Trending content creates urgency
- **Example:** Instagram Stories, Twitter trends

**The Psychological Impact:**

**Research Findings:**
- Average person checks phone 96 times per day
- Social media linked to anxiety, depression, sleep issues
- Particularly harmful to adolescents
- "Compulsive media experiences" hijack attention

**Quote from Research:**
"Short-form vertical videos are designed to be compulsive... they hijack your brain and keep you coming back to their apps."

**The Ethical Dilemma:**
"As content creators, we are creating the bait for the trap. Are we responsible for the trap itself?"

#### 3. Editing for Engagement vs. Editing for Value (15 min)

**The Tension:**

**Editing for Engagement (Algorithm Optimization):**
- Hook in first 2 seconds (stop the scroll)
- Fast pacing (maintain attention)
- Cliffhangers and loops (encourage rewatch)
- Trending sounds and formats (algorithm boost)
- Emotional manipulation (anger, outrage, excitement)
- **Goal:** Maximum views, likes, shares

**Editing for Value (Audience Service):**
- Clear, useful information
- Respectful pacing (not overwhelming)
- Honest representation
- Thoughtful messaging
- **Goal:** Genuine help, education, inspiration

**Can You Do Both?**

**Yes, but it requires:**
1. **Intentionality:** Know why you're using each technique
2. **Boundaries:** Refuse manipulative tactics
3. **Transparency:** Be honest about persuasion
4. **Respect:** Treat audience as intelligent humans, not metrics

**Examples of Ethical Engagement:**

**Good:** Educational TikTok that hooks with interesting question, delivers value, ends with clear takeaway
**Bad:** Rage-bait content that misleads in hook, wastes time, exists only for engagement

**Good:** Product ad that clearly shows benefits, honest about limitations, respects viewer's intelligence
**Bad:** Product ad that creates insecurity, makes false promises, manipulates emotions

**Discussion:** "Where do you draw the line? What tactics are you comfortable using?"

> *"The ethical editor asks: Am I serving the audience, or am I serving the algorithm? The answer reveals your values."*

---

### Screening & Analysis: Platform Optimization & Ethics (40 minutes)

#### Example 1: Same Content, Different Platforms (15 min)

**Screen:** Brand campaign adapted for multiple platforms
- TV version (30s, horizontal, polished)
- YouTube version (15s pre-roll, horizontal, quick hook)
- TikTok version (30s, vertical, native style)
- Instagram version (square, aesthetic, captions)

**Analysis:**
- How does editing change for each platform?
- What stays the same? What changes?
- Which version is most effective for its platform?
- How does format affect message?

#### Example 2: Ethical vs. Manipulative Advertising (15 min)

**Screen Two Ads:**

**Ad A: Ethical Approach**
- Clear product benefits
- Honest representation
- Respects viewer intelligence
- Transparent about what product does/doesn't do

**Ad B: Manipulative Approach**
- Creates insecurity or fear
- Exaggerates benefits
- Uses deceptive editing
- Exploits psychological vulnerabilities

**Discussion:**
- What makes Ad A ethical?
- What makes Ad B manipulative?
- Where is the line?
- Can persuasion be ethical?

#### Example 3: Addictive Design in Action (10 min)

**Screen:** TikTok compilation showing addictive patterns
- Hooks that stop scrolling
- Loops that encourage rewatch
- Cliffhangers that demand continuation
- Emotional manipulation

**Analysis:**
- How do these techniques work?
- Are they inherently unethical?
- When does engagement optimization become exploitation?
- What would you do differently?

**Key Question:** "If you were hired to create content for a brand, and they asked you to use manipulative tactics, what would you do?"

- Individual responsibility vs. systemic change

#### Debrief (10 minutes)

**Instructor Facilitates:**
- "What did you learn from hearing different perspectives?"
- "Where do YOU stand now?"
- "How will this affect your work as an editor?"
- "What ethical guidelines will you follow?"

**Key Takeaway:**
"There are no easy answers. But asking the questions is essential. The ethical editor is always questioning, always reflecting, always choosing consciously."

> *"Ethics is not a destination. Ethics is a practice. Every cut is a choice. Every choice reveals your values."*

- Would I feel comfortable if my family saw this?

**2. Respect**
- Am I treating the audience as intelligent humans?
- Am I exploiting insecurities or fears?
- Am I reinforcing harmful stereotypes?

**3. Value**
- Does this content provide genuine value?

- Am I willing to sacrifice some effectiveness for ethics?

---

## Theory Integration: The Editor's Responsibility

### The Power and the Burden

**With Great Power...**

As editors, we have the power to:
- Shape perception through juxtaposition (Kuleshov Effect)
- Manipulate emotion through pacing and music
- Create associations through montage
- Capture attention through platform optimization
- Influence behavior through persuasive techniques

**...Comes Great Responsibility**

We must ask:
- Am I using this power ethically?
- Am I serving the audience or exploiting them?
- Am I contributing to a healthier or more toxic media environment?
- What world am I helping to create?

### The Systemic vs. Individual Tension

**The Argument:**
"I'm just one editor. The system is the problem. My individual choices don't matter."

**The Counter-Argument:**
"Systems are made of individuals. Every ethical choice matters. Cultural change happens through accumulated individual actions."

**The Synthesis:**
"Work for systemic change (regulation, platform accountability) AND make ethical individual choices. Both are necessary."

### Historical Precedents

**Propaganda and Editing:**
- Leni Riefenstahl's *Triumph of the Will* (1935) - Masterful editing in service of Nazism
- Soviet montage - Revolutionary art that became propaganda tool
- Modern question: Can technique be separated from content?

**Advertising and Social Movements:**
- Brands appropriating feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, environmentalism
- "Woke-washing" or genuine support?
- Editor's role: Complicit or critical?

**The Lesson:**
"Editing is never neutral. Every cut is political. Every frame is ethical. Choose wisely."

> *"The ethical editor knows: Every frame carries responsibility. Edit with conscience, create with care, release with humility."*
