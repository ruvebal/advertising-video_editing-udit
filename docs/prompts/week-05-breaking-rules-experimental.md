## Session A: Jump Cuts, Nonlinear Stories, and Postmodern Style (2 hours)

### Opening (10 minutes)

> *"The rules exist to serve the story. When the story demands their breaking, break them boldly."*

**Recap Week 4:**
- Montage creates meaning through juxtaposition
- Kuleshov Effect: context changes perception
- "Last week we learned the power of collision. This week we learn the power of chaos—controlled chaos."

**Today's Liberation:**
"For 100 years, cinema followed continuity rules. Then in the 1960s, young filmmakers said: 'What if we just... didn't?' And cinema was never the same."

**Demonstrate:**
- Show smooth continuity edit
- Show same scene with jump cuts
- "Which feels more energetic? More modern? More real?"

---

### Core Lecture: The Revolution of Rule-Breaking (50 minutes)

#### 1. French New Wave: The Jump Cut (20 min)

**Historical Context:**
- Post-WWII France, young critics turned filmmakers
- Rejected Hollywood polish and studio system
- Embraced spontaneity, location shooting, handheld cameras
- Limited budgets forced creative solutions

**Jean-Luc Godard and *Breathless* (1960):**

**The Famous Jump Cut Sequence:**
- Patricia and Michel driving in car
- Conversation jumps forward in time
- Violates continuity (spatial jumps, temporal ellipsis)
- Creates energy and modernity

**Why Godard Did It:**
1. **Practical:** Film was too long, needed to cut scenes down
2. **Aesthetic:** Wanted to break Hollywood conventions
3. **Philosophical:** Remind viewers they're watching a film (Brechtian alienation)
4. **Energy:** Jump cuts feel urgent, immediate, real

**The Jump Cut Defined:**
- Cut within same shot/scene that creates visible discontinuity
- Subject "jumps" in space or time
- Violates match-on-action and spatial continuity
- Draws attention to the edit itself

**Screen:** *Breathless* jump cut sequence (3-5 minutes)

**Analysis:**
- Count the jumps (often 5-10 in one conversation)
- How does it feel? Jarring? Exciting? Modern?
- Does it serve the story? (Yes: captures restless energy of characters)

**Modern Applications:**

**1. Vlog/YouTube Style:**
- Jump cuts remove pauses, "ums," dead space
- Keeps pace fast, maintains attention
- Feels authentic, unpolished

**2. TikTok/Instagram:**
- Jump cuts for comedic timing
- Rapid costume/location changes
- "Glow up" transformations

**3. Advertising:**
- Youth brands (energy drinks, fashion)
- Tech products (fast-paced innovation)
- Social media ads (native to platform aesthetic)

> *"The jump cut says: 'I am not hiding the edit. I am celebrating it.'"*

#### 2. Nonlinear Narratives: Tarantino and Beyond (20 min)

**Quentin Tarantino's *Pulp Fiction* (1994):**

**The Structure:**
- Story told out of chronological order
- Three interwoven narratives
- Character dies in middle, appears alive at end
- Audience must mentally reassemble timeline

**Why Nonlinear?:**
1. **Intrigue:** Mystery keeps viewers engaged
2. **Thematic:** Emphasizes themes over plot
3. **Surprise:** Reveals information strategically
4. **Artistic:** Challenges conventional storytelling

**Other Examples:**
- *Memento* (Christopher Nolan, 2000): Backwards chronology
- *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* (2004): Memory fragments
- *Arrival* (2016): Non-linear time perception

**Screen:** *Pulp Fiction* - Opening diner scene + Ending diner scene
- Show how they connect (same scene, bookends)
- Discuss how nonlinear structure creates meaning

**Nonlinear in Advertising:**

**Challenges:**
- 30-60 seconds is very short for complex structure
- Risk of confusion (viewers won't rewatch)
- Message must still be clear

**When It Works:**
- Teaser campaigns (mystery builds over multiple ads)
- Luxury brands (artistic, sophisticated audience)
- Movie trailers (spoiler-free intrigue)

**Example:** Perfume ads often use dreamlike, non-chronological imagery

**Discussion:** "When is nonlinear structure worth the risk in advertising?"

#### 3. MTV Aesthetics and Music Video Editing (10 min)

**The MTV Revolution (1981-present):**

**Characteristics:**
- Rapid cutting (often 1-2 seconds per shot)
- Stylized transitions (wipes, spins, zooms)
- Visual effects and graphics
- Breaking the fourth wall
- Performance + narrative + abstract imagery

**Influence on Advertising:**
- Fast-paced commercial editing
- Music-driven cuts
- Youth-oriented brands adopted MTV style
- "Commercial break" became entertainment itself

**Modern Evolution:**
- TikTok is "MTV for Gen Z"
- Vertical format, even faster cuts
- Meme culture and remix aesthetics
- User-generated content style

**Screen:** Classic MTV-style ad (Nike, Pepsi, or modern equivalent)

**Analysis:**
- Cuts per minute (often 60-100+)
- How does speed affect emotion?
- Does it feel dated or timeless?

> *"MTV taught us: Editing can be the star. The cut can be as important as the content."*

---

### Screening & Analysis: Rule-Breaking in Advertising (40 minutes)

#### Example 1: Jump Cuts for Energy (Youth Brand) (12 min)

**Screen:** Energy drink or youth fashion ad with jump cuts

**Analysis:**
- How many jump cuts? Where?
- Does it feel chaotic or controlled?
- Target audience: Why does this appeal to them?
- Would this work for a luxury brand? Why not?

#### Example 2: Nonlinear/Dreamlike (Luxury/Perfume) (12 min)

**Screen:** High-end perfume or luxury car ad with abstract structure

**Analysis:**
- Can you follow a clear narrative? Should you?
- How does ambiguity serve the brand?
- What emotions are evoked?
- Target audience: Sophisticated, artistic consumers

#### Example 3: MTV-Style Rapid Cutting (Music/Entertainment) (12 min)

**Screen:** Music streaming service, concert promotion, or entertainment ad

**Analysis:**
- Cuts per 10 seconds (count them)
- How does rhythm match music?
- Visual effects and transitions used
- Does it feel overwhelming or exciting?

**Comparative Discussion:**
Create chart on board:

| Style | Best For | Avoid For |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Jump Cuts | Youth brands, social media, vlogs | Luxury, medical, financial |
| Nonlinear | Artistic brands, teasers, trailers | Product demos, tutorials |
| MTV Rapid | Music, entertainment, energy | Detailed information, elderly audience |

**Key Insight:** "Know your audience and platform. Rule-breaking must serve the message."

---

### Technical Workshop: Experimental Techniques in Premiere Pro (30 minutes)

#### 1. Jump Cuts (5 min)

**Simple Method:**
1. Place long clip on timeline
2. Use Razor tool (C) to cut out sections
3. Delete middle portions
4. Result: Subject jumps forward in time/space

**Pro Tip:** Cut on movement or speech for less jarring jumps

#### 2. Speed Ramping (10 min)

**Creating Dynamic Speed Changes:**

**Method 1: Speed/Duration**
```
1. Right-click clip > Speed/Duration
2. Change speed (50% = slow, 200% = fast)
3. Check "Ripple Edit" to maintain timeline length
```

**Method 2: Time Remapping (Advanced)**
```
1. Right-click clip > Show Clip Keyframes > Time Remapping > Speed
2. Ctrl+Click on speed line to add keyframes
3. Drag between keyframes to create ramps
4. Smooth transitions between speeds
```

**Demonstrate:** Slow-motion punch → Normal speed → Fast-motion run

**Applications:**
- Action emphasis (slow-mo)
- Comedic effect (fast-forward)
- Transitions between scenes
- Music video dynamics

#### 3. Glitch Effects and Distortion (8 min)

**Creating Digital Glitch:**

**Method 1: VHS Effect**
```
Effects > Video Effects > Distort > Wave Warp
Adjust wave height and speed
Add noise for authentic VHS look
```

**Method 2: RGB Split**
```
Effects > Video Effects > Channel > Channel Blur
Separate red, green, blue channels
Creates chromatic aberration
```

**Method 3: Datamosh/Pixelation**
```
Effects > Video Effects > Stylize > Mosaic
Animate block size for glitch effect
```

**When to Use:**
- Tech/gaming brands
- Cyberpunk aesthetics
- Error/malfunction narrative
- Artistic/experimental ads

#### 4. Whip Pans and Smash Cuts (7 min)

**Whip Pan Transition:**
```
1. End clip with fast pan (blur)
2. Start next clip with fast pan (same direction)
3. Cut in the middle of motion
4. Creates seamless, energetic transition
```

**Smash Cut:**
- Abrupt cut from one scene to completely different scene
- No transition, maximum contrast
- Creates shock or comedy

**Demonstrate both techniques live**

**Applications:**
- Music videos
- Action sequences
- Comedic timing
- Scene transitions with energy

> *"Speed ramping is the editor's time machine. Glitches are the editor's rebellion. Whip pans are the editor's exclamation point."*

## Community Best Practices: Experimental Editing

### From Professional Editors

**1. "Break Rules with Purpose"**
- Every unconventional choice should serve story/emotion
- Ask: "Why am I doing this?"
- If answer is "because it's cool," reconsider

**2. "Know Your Audience"**
- Experimental works for some demographics, not others
- Gen Z embraces chaos, older audiences prefer clarity
- Platform matters: TikTok vs. TV commercial

**3. "Test on Fresh Eyes"**
- Show to someone unfamiliar with project
- If they're confused, simplify
- If they're bored, push further

**4. "Less is More (Sometimes)"**
- One bold technique can be more effective than five
- Don't overwhelm with effects
- Let technique breathe

**5. "Music Saves Everything"**
- Right music can make chaotic edit feel intentional
- Rhythm guides viewer through complexity
- Silence can also be powerful

### Experimental Techniques in Modern Advertising

**Brands Using Jump Cuts:**
- Dollar Shave Club (viral video)
- Casper Mattress (YouTube ads)
- Most direct-to-consumer brands

**Brands Using Nonlinear:**
- Luxury perfumes (Chanel, Dior)
- High-end automotive (BMW art films)
- Artistic campaigns (Apple "Shot on iPhone")

**Brands Using MTV/Rapid Style:**
- Music streaming (Spotify, Apple Music)
- Energy drinks (Red Bull, Monster)
- Gaming (PlayStation, Xbox)
- Fast fashion (H&M, Zara)

**The Pattern:**
- Younger audience = more experimental
- Premium brands = artistic license
- Mass market = safer, clearer

## Theory Integration: Postmodernism and Editing

### What is Postmodern Editing?

**Characteristics:**
- Self-aware (acknowledges it's a film/ad)
- Pastiche and remix (references other works)
- Irony and playfulness
- Rejection of grand narratives
- Fragmentation and non-linearity

**Examples in Film:**
- Tarantino: References, non-linear, genre mixing
- Wes Anderson: Symmetry, artificiality, storybook quality
- Edgar Wright: Visual comedy, rapid cuts, sound design

**Examples in Advertising:**
- Old Spice "The Man Your Man Could Smell Like" (absurdist, self-aware)
- Geico ads (meta-humor, breaking fourth wall)
- Skittles surreal campaigns

### The Ethics of Experimental Editing

**Questions to Consider:**

**1. Clarity vs. Artistry**
- Does experimental editing serve the message?
- Or does it obscure it for artistic ego?
- In advertising, clarity often trumps artistry

**2. Accessibility**
- Rapid cuts can trigger seizures (epilepsy warning)
- Complex narratives exclude some audiences
- Is your creativity inclusive or elitist?

**3. Authenticity vs. Manipulation**
- Jump cuts feel "real" (vlog style)
- But they're still heavily edited
- Are you being honest about the construction?

**4. Trend vs. Timelessness**
- Experimental techniques date quickly
- What's cool now may look silly in 5 years
- Balance trendy with timeless

> *"The ethical experimental editor asks: Am I breaking rules to serve the audience, or to serve my ego?"*

- Nonlinear should be puzzle, not chaos

### Facilitation Tips

**Encourage Boldness:**
- "This is your chance to go wild"
- "Make something that surprises me"
- "Don't play it safe"

**But Provide Guardrails:**
- "Bold with purpose"
- "Experimental doesn't mean random"
- "Serve the message, not your ego"

**Celebrate Failure:**
- "If it doesn't work, you learned something"
- "Experimentation means some experiments fail"
- "Iteration is part of the process"

> *"The master editor knows: To find your voice, you must first try many voices. Some will fit, others will not. This is the path."*
