## Session A: The Commercial Formula and Creative Constraints (2 hours)

### Opening (10 minutes)

> *"Every second counts. Literally. In advertising, time is not just money—it is the canvas itself."*

**Recap Week 5:**
- Experimental editing: jump cuts, nonlinear, speed ramping
- Breaking rules with purpose
- "Last week we broke free. This week we work within the tightest constraints of all: 30 seconds and a client brief."

**Today's Challenge:**
"How do you tell a complete story—with setup, conflict, resolution, and call-to-action—in less time than it takes to tie your shoes?"

**Demonstrate:**
- Show 30-second timer
- "This is your canvas. Every frame matters."

---

### Core Lecture: Advertising Narrative Structures (50 minutes)

#### 1. Time Constraints and Their Evolution (10 min)

**The History of Ad Length:**

**1950s-1980s: The 60-Second Spot**
- Standard TV commercial length
- Time for full narrative arc
- Expensive but effective

**1980s-2000s: The 30-Second Spot**
- Became new standard (cost efficiency)
- Forces economy of storytelling
- Still dominant on TV

**2000s-2010s: The 15-Second Spot**
- Digital platforms, shorter attention spans
- Quick message delivery
- Often used in series

**2010s-Present: The 6-Second Bumper**
- YouTube non-skippable
- Ultra-concise messaging
- Brand awareness only

**2020s: Variable Length (Social Media)**
- TikTok: 15-60 seconds optimal
- Instagram Reels: 15-90 seconds
- YouTube: Any length, but hook in first 5 seconds

**Key Insight:** "The shorter the time, the more important every frame becomes."

#### 2. Classic Advertising Narrative Structures (30 min)

**Structure 1: Problem/Solution (The Most Common)**

**Formula:**
1. **Problem** (0-10 seconds): Show pain point
2. **Solution** (10-20 seconds): Introduce product
3. **Result** (20-25 seconds): Show benefit/transformation
4. **Call-to-Action** (25-30 seconds): Brand + message

**Example:** Cleaning product ad
- Problem: Dirty kitchen, frustrated person
- Solution: Product introduced, easy application
- Result: Sparkling clean, happy person
- CTA: "Brand X - Clean in seconds"

**Why It Works:**
- Relatable (everyone has problems)
- Clear cause-and-effect
- Product is the hero

**Editing Approach:**
- Continuity editing for clarity
- Before/after contrast
- Tight pacing (no wasted moments)

---

**Structure 2: Emotional Appeal (The Heart String)**

**Formula:**
1. **Emotion** (0-20 seconds): Build feeling (joy, nostalgia, inspiration)
2. **Connection** (20-25 seconds): Link emotion to brand
3. **Brand Reveal** (25-30 seconds): Logo, tagline, CTA

**Example:** Coca-Cola, Nike "Just Do It"
- Montage of human moments (family, achievement, connection)
- Music builds emotion
- Brand appears at end with message

**Why It Works:**
- Emotional memory stronger than rational
- Brand becomes associated with feeling
- Aspirational rather than functional

**Editing Approach:**
- Montage editing (Eisenstein style)
- Music-driven cuts
- Rhythm builds to crescendo

---

**Structure 3: Slice of Life (The Relatable Moment)**

**Formula:**
1. **Scene** (0-15 seconds): Everyday situation
2. **Product Integration** (15-25 seconds): Naturally appears in scene
3. **Payoff** (25-30 seconds): Situation resolved, brand message

**Example:** Coffee commercial
- Morning routine, tired person
- Coffee brewed, enjoyed
- Energized, ready for day
- "Brand X - Start your day right"

**Why It Works:**
- Feels authentic, not "salesy"
- Viewers see themselves in situation
- Product fits naturally into life

**Editing Approach:**
- Continuity editing (feels real)
- Natural pacing (not rushed)
- Observational style

---

**Structure 4: Testimonial/Social Proof (The Endorsement)**

**Formula:**
1. **Setup** (0-5 seconds): Who is speaking, why trust them
2. **Testimonial** (5-25 seconds): Their experience with product
3. **CTA** (25-30 seconds): Brand + offer

**Example:** Real customers, celebrity endorsements, expert opinions

**Why It Works:**
- Trust transfer (if I trust them, I trust product)
- Social proof (others use it, so should I)
- Authenticity (real people, real results)

**Editing Approach:**
- Interview style (talking head)
- B-roll over testimonial (show product in use)
- Graphics for emphasis (quotes, stats)

---

**Structure 5: Demonstration (The Proof)**

**Formula:**
1. **Challenge** (0-10 seconds): What product claims to do
2. **Demo** (10-25 seconds): Show it working
3. **Result** (25-30 seconds): Success + CTA

**Example:** Infomercial style, tech products, "as seen on TV"

**Why It Works:**
- "Seeing is believing"
- Addresses skepticism directly
- Clear value proposition

**Editing Approach:**
- Close-ups of product
- Slow motion for key moments
- Clear before/after

---

**Structure 6: Humor/Surprise (The Twist)**

**Formula:**
1. **Setup** (0-15 seconds): Establish expectation
2. **Twist** (15-25 seconds): Subvert expectation (humor or surprise)
3. **Payoff** (25-30 seconds): Brand connection + CTA

**Example:** Old Spice "The Man Your Man Could Smell Like", Geico ads

**Why It Works:**
- Memorable (humor sticks)
- Shareability (people want to show friends)
- Cuts through ad clutter

**Editing Approach:**
- Timing is everything (comedy = timing)
- Smash cuts for surprise
- Deadpan vs. frenetic pacing

> *"The structure is your skeleton. The editing is your flesh. The emotion is your soul."*

#### 3. Platform-Specific Considerations (10 min)

**TV Commercial (Traditional):**
- **Length:** 30 or 60 seconds
- **Format:** 16:9 horizontal
- **Sound:** Essential (viewers expect audio)
- **Pacing:** Can build slowly (captive audience)
- **Branding:** Clear at beginning and end
- **Quality:** High production value expected

**YouTube Pre-Roll:**
- **Length:** 6 seconds (non-skippable) or 15-30 seconds (skippable after 5)
- **Format:** 16:9 horizontal
- **Hook:** MUST grab in first 5 seconds or lose viewer
- **Sound:** Optional (many watch muted)
- **Branding:** Immediate (brand in first 3 seconds)
- **CTA:** Clear and quick

**TikTok:**
- **Length:** 15-60 seconds (sweet spot: 21-34 seconds)
- **Format:** 9:16 vertical (fills phone screen)
- **Hook:** First 2 seconds critical (stop the scroll)
- **Sound:** Trending audio helps algorithm
- **Style:** Native content (doesn't look like ad)
- **Captions:** Essential (many watch muted)
- **Loop:** End should connect to beginning (encourages rewatch)

**Instagram Feed:**
- **Length:** 15-60 seconds
- **Format:** 1:1 square or 4:5 portrait
- **Thumbnail:** First frame is preview (make it count)
- **Sound:** Optional
- **Captions:** Recommended
- **Aesthetic:** Polished, on-brand

**Instagram Stories/Reels:**
- **Length:** 15 seconds per story slide, up to 90 for Reels
- **Format:** 9:16 vertical
- **Interactive:** Polls, swipe-ups, stickers
- **Ephemeral:** Stories disappear (creates urgency)
- **Authentic:** Less polished okay

**Create Comparison Chart on Board:**

| Platform | Length | Format | Hook Time | Sound | Style |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|-------|
| TV | 30-60s | 16:9 | 5-10s | Required | Polished |
| YouTube | 6-30s | 16:9 | 5s | Optional | Polished |
| TikTok | 15-60s | 9:16 | 2s | Important | Native |
| Instagram | 15-60s | 1:1, 4:5, 9:16 | 3s | Optional | Aesthetic |

**Discussion:** "How would you adapt the same message for different platforms?"

### Screening & Analysis: Deconstructing Great Ads (40 minutes)

#### Example 1: Apple "1984" (60 seconds - Classic TV) (15 min)

**Screen:** Full ad

**Deconstruction:**
- **Structure:** Emotional appeal + surprise
- **0-40s:** Build dystopian world (problem)
- **40-55s:** Heroine destroys screen (solution/revolution)
- **55-60s:** Text reveal (brand + message)

**Editing Analysis:**
- Slow build (can afford it at 60 seconds)
- Montage of gray workers vs. colorful athlete
- Slow motion at climax (emphasis)
- Minimal dialogue (visual storytelling)

**Why It's Great:**
- Tells complete story
- Memorable imagery
- Clear brand positioning (Apple = rebel)
- Aired once (Super Bowl 1984) but became legend

**Discussion:** "Could this work as a 30-second spot? What would you cut?"

#### Example 2: Modern 30-Second Spot (15 min)

**Screen:** Recent award-winning commercial (Cannes Lions winner)

**Deconstruction:**
- Identify structure (problem/solution, emotional, etc.)
- Count shots (often 15-25 in 30 seconds)
- Note pacing (where does it slow down, speed up?)
- Brand integration (when does product appear?)
- CTA (how clear is the call-to-action?)

**Editing Analysis:**
- Cuts per second
- Use of music
- Transitions
- Text overlays

**Discussion:** "What makes this effective for its platform and audience?"

#### Example 3: TikTok Native Ad (10 min)

**Screen:** Successful TikTok brand ad

**Deconstruction:**
- **Hook:** What grabs you in first 2 seconds?
- **Format:** Vertical, fills screen
- **Style:** Does it feel like organic TikTok content?
- **Trend:** Does it use trending sound/format?
- **CTA:** How is brand integrated?

**Comparison to TV Ad:**
- Faster pacing
- Less polished (intentionally)
- More direct address to camera
- Participatory (encourages duets, stitches)

**Discussion:** "Why wouldn't a traditional TV ad work on TikTok?"

## Session B: Rapid Storyboarding Workshop (2 hours)

### Opening (10 minutes)

> *"The storyboard is the editor's blueprint. Build well, and the edit builds itself."*

**Today's Focus:**
"Storyboarding is pre-editing. Every panel is a shot. Every sequence is an edit. Master this, and you master efficiency."

**Team Videothon Preview:**
"Next week, you'll have limited time to shoot and edit. The teams that plan well will succeed. The teams that don't... will learn a valuable lesson."

---

### Storyboarding Masterclass (40 minutes)

#### 1. What is a Storyboard? (10 min)

**Definition:**
Visual representation of your edit, shot by shot, before you film.

**Components of Each Panel:**
1. **Visual:** Sketch or description of shot
2. **Shot Type:** Wide, medium, close-up, etc.
3. **Camera Movement:** Static, pan, tilt, dolly, etc.
4. **Duration:** Approximate seconds
5. **Audio:** Dialogue, music, sound effects
6. **Notes:** Special instructions, transitions

**Why Storyboard?**
- **Saves time:** Know exactly what to shoot
- **Prevents mistakes:** Catch problems before filming
- **Communicates vision:** Team understands plan
- **Guides editing:** Roadmap for post-production

**Show Examples:**
- Professional storyboards (Pixar, commercial production)
- Simple stick-figure storyboards (still effective)
- Digital storyboards (apps like Storyboarder)

#### 2. Storyboarding for Advertising (15 min)

**Key Principles:**

**1. Every Shot Has Purpose**
- Establishes location
- Shows product
- Reveals emotion
- Provides information
- Transitions to next beat

**2. Think in Beats**
- Beat 1: Setup (who, where, what)
- Beat 2: Conflict/need
- Beat 3: Product introduction
- Beat 4: Resolution
- Beat 5: CTA

**3. Plan for Editing**
- Coverage: Multiple angles of key moments
- Cutaways: B-roll for transitions
- Inserts: Close-ups of product, hands, details
- Reactions: Faces responding to action

**4. Time Management**
- 30 seconds = roughly 15-20 shots (2 seconds each)
- Or 6-10 shots (3-5 seconds each)
- Depends on pacing desired

**5. Brand Integration**
- When does product appear? (Usually by 10-second mark)
- How is logo shown? (Pack shot, in-use, environment)
- Where is CTA? (Usually final 5 seconds)

#### 3. Common Storyboarding Mistakes (10 min)

**Mistake 1: Too Ambitious**
- Planning 50 shots for 30 seconds
- Complex locations or effects
- **Solution:** Simplify, focus on core message

**Mistake 2: No Coverage**
- Only one angle per moment
- No cutaways or inserts
- **Solution:** Plan wide, medium, close-up for key beats

**Mistake 3: Ignoring Transitions**
- Shots don't connect logically
- Spatial confusion
- **Solution:** Plan how each shot leads to next

**Mistake 4: Forgetting Audio**
- No plan for dialogue, music, or sound effects
- **Solution:** Note audio for each shot

**Mistake 5: Unclear Timing**
- No sense of pacing
- **Solution:** Write approximate duration on each panel

#### 4. Demo: Storyboarding Live (5 min)

**Instructor demonstrates:**
- Take a simple brief: "30-second ad for eco-friendly water bottle, target: college students"
- Choose structure: Problem/solution
- Sketch 8 panels live:
  1. Wide: Student in class, plastic bottle (3s)
  2. Close-up: Plastic bottle in trash (2s)
  3. Medium: Student researching on phone (2s)
  4. Close-up: Product website (2s)
  5. Medium: Student receives package (3s)
  6. Close-up: Product reveal (3s)
  7. Montage: Student using bottle in various locations (10s)
  8. Wide: Student happy, logo + CTA (5s)

**Total: 30 seconds, 8 shots**

## Theory Integration: Constraints and Creativity

### The Paradox of Limitation

**Thesis:** Constraints don't limit creativity—they focus it.

**Examples:**

**1. Haiku Poetry**
- 5-7-5 syllable structure
- Extreme limitation
- Result: Profound beauty in economy

**2. Twitter (Original 140 characters)**
- Forced brevity
- Result: New form of communication

**3. Dogme 95 (Film Movement)**
- Rules: No props, no post-production sound, handheld camera only
- Result: Raw, powerful cinema

**4. 30-Second Commercials**
- Extreme time limitation
- Result: Distilled storytelling mastery

**The Principle:**
"When you can't do everything, you must do the essential. The essential is often the most powerful."

### The Ethics of Advertising Storytelling

**Questions:**

**1. Emotional Manipulation**
- Is it ethical to use storytelling techniques to sell products?
- Where's the line between persuasion and manipulation?

**2. Creating Needs**
- Advertising often creates problems to solve
- "You didn't know you needed this until we told you"
- Is this ethical?

**3. Representation**
- Who is shown in ads? Who is excluded?
- Stereotypes vs. authentic representation
- Responsibility to diverse audiences

**4. Truth in Advertising**
- Editing can make products seem better than they are
- Selective showing (hide flaws, emphasize benefits)
- Legal vs. ethical truth

> *"The ethical advertiser asks: Am I helping people make informed choices, or am I manipulating them into choices that serve only me?"*
