# Week 7: Production Sprint – Team Edit-on-Camera Videothon
## Lesson Development Prompt for Instructors

> *"The battle is won before the first shot is fired. The edit succeeds before the first cut is made."*  
> — Tao of the Video Editor

---

## Context & Learning Goals

### Historical Foundation
- **Early Cinema Constraints:** Filmmakers like Méliès planned everything due to inability to edit in post
- **Live Television (1950s):** Everything shot in sequence, minimal editing
- **Guerrilla Filmmaking:** Low-budget, fast production, creative problem-solving
- **48-Hour Film Festivals:** Modern tradition of rapid filmmaking under constraint

### Technical Skills to Introduce
- Edit-in-camera techniques (planning shots in sequence)
- Rapid production workflow
- Team collaboration and role assignment
- Problem-solving under time pressure
- Quick editing and assembly
- Efficient export and delivery

### Critical Thinking Objectives
- How does time pressure affect creative decisions?
- What's the relationship between planning and execution?
- How do teams function under stress?
- What's essential vs. nice-to-have in production?
- How do you adapt when plans fail?

### Week 7 Success Indicators
By the end of Week 7, students should be able to:
- ✓ Execute a complete production from concept to delivery in 2 hours
- ✓ Work effectively in a team under pressure
- ✓ Adapt plans when reality doesn't match expectations
- ✓ Prioritize essential elements over perfection
- ✓ Deliver a finished product on deadline
- ✓ Reflect on process and learn from experience

## Session A: Videothon Planning & Storyboard Refinement (2 hours)

### Opening (15 minutes)

> *"In the crucible of constraint, creativity is refined. In the pressure of time, teamwork is forged."*

**Recap Week 6:**
- Advertising structures and formats
- Storyboarding for efficiency
- Platform-specific considerations

**Today's Mission:**
"You have this session to plan perfectly. Next session, you execute. There is no time for hesitation, no room for confusion. Your storyboard is your battle plan."

**The Videothon Challenge Explained:**

**Rules:**
1. **Time Limit:** 2 hours total (Session B)
   - 60 minutes: Filming
   - 45 minutes: Editing
   - 15 minutes: Export and screening prep

2. **Deliverable:** 30-60 second advertisement
   - Must have clear message
   - Must include branding/CTA
   - Must be complete (not rough cut)

3. **Edit-in-Camera Spirit:**
   - Plan shots in sequence
   - Minimize post-production reliance
   - Use camera pause button as "edit"
   - OR shoot coverage but edit quickly

4. **Team Roles:**
   - Director (vision keeper, decision maker)
   - Camera Operator (framing, technical)
   - Talent (on-camera, if needed)
   - Editor (assembly, polish)
   - (Roles can overlap in small teams)

**Inspiration:**
"This simulates real-world conditions: Client needs ad by tomorrow. Budget is tight. Team is small. Make it work."

- Review footage as you go (catch problems early)

#### Location Planning (10 min)

**Teams finalize:**
- Where will you film? (Classroom, hallway, outdoor space, etc.)
- Backup location if first choice is unavailable
- How long to get there and back?
- Permission needed? (If leaving campus)

**Instructor Sets Boundaries:**
- Must stay on campus (or within X distance)
- Must return by [specific time] for editing
- Safety first (no dangerous stunts)

#### Role Confirmation (5 min)

**Each team confirms:**
- **Director:** [Name] - Makes final decisions, keeps team on track
- **Camera:** [Name] - Operates camera, ensures technical quality
- **Talent:** [Name] - On-camera (if needed), or helps with props/continuity
- **Editor:** [Name] - Will assemble footage in post

**Note:** Roles can be flexible, but having clear assignments prevents confusion.

#### Pep Talk & Final Questions (5 min)

**Instructor:**
"Tomorrow is game day. You've planned well. Trust your plan, but be ready to adapt. Things will go wrong—that's guaranteed. The teams that succeed are the ones that stay calm, communicate, and focus on the essential.

Remember: Done is better than perfect. A finished 30-second ad is better than an unfinished masterpiece.

You've got this. Any final questions?"

**Answer questions, address concerns.**

> *"Preparation eliminates fear. You have prepared. Therefore, you will succeed."*

- Final shots
- Pack up equipment
- Return to classroom
- Transfer footage to editing computer

**Common Challenges (and Solutions):**

**Challenge: Location is busy/unavailable**
- Solution: Move to backup location immediately
- Don't waste time hoping it clears

**Challenge: Talent is nervous/awkward**
- Solution: Do multiple takes, give direction
- Or pivot to non-talent approach (B-roll only)

**Challenge: Technical issues (camera, audio)**
- Solution: Use phone as backup
- Simplify audio plan (music only, no dialogue)

**Challenge: Running out of time**
- Solution: Prioritize essential shots

## Community Best Practices: Rapid Production

### From Professional Filmmakers & Editors

**1. "Storyboard or Die"**
- No time to figure it out on set
- Every shot must be planned
- Coverage list is essential

**2. "The 80/20 Rule"**
- 80% of impact comes from 20% of shots
- Identify those critical shots
- Prioritize them in filming

**3. "Audio Saves Bad Video, Video Can't Save Bad Audio"**
- Check audio first, always
- Bad audio = unusable footage
- Music can cover many sins

**4. "Shoot for the Edit"**
- Think about transitions while filming
- Get cutaways and inserts
- Overlap action for cutting options

**5. "When in Doubt, Go Wider"**
- Wide shots are safer (less can go wrong)
- Easier to stabilize in post
- Establishes context

### Real-World Rapid Production Examples

**News Production:**
- Story breaks, must air in 2 hours
- Reporter, camera, editor work in parallel
- Edit while footage still coming in

**Social Media Content:**
- Brands create daily content
- Shoot in morning, post by afternoon
- Speed over perfection

**Event Coverage:**
- Wedding videographers edit highlights same-day
- Conference videos delivered next morning
- Client expectations demand speed

**Guerrilla Advertising:**
- Pop-up campaigns, flash mobs
- Capture and edit quickly for viral potential
- Authenticity over polish

## Theory Integration: Creativity Under Constraint

### The Psychology of Deadlines

**Research Shows:**
- Moderate time pressure increases creativity
- Too much pressure decreases quality
- Too little pressure decreases motivation
- Sweet spot: Challenging but achievable

**The Videothon Sweet Spot:**
- 2 hours is tight but possible
- Forces focus on essentials
- Eliminates overthinking
- Creates shared intensity (bonding)

### The Value of Constraints

**Historical Examples:**

**1. Twitter's 140 Characters**
- Forced brevity
- Created new communication style
- Constraint became the feature

**2. Dogme 95 Film Movement**
- Strict rules (no props, handheld only, etc.)
- Resulted in raw, powerful cinema
- Constraint inspired innovation

**3. Early Hip-Hop**
- Limited equipment (two turntables)
- Sampling as creative constraint
- Birth of new art form

**4. Your Videothon**
- 2 hours, small team, minimal equipment
- Forces creativity and collaboration
- Produces authentic, energetic work

> *"Constraint is not the enemy of creativity. Constraint is the forge in which creativity is tempered into mastery."*

### Team Dynamics Under Pressure

**Tuckman's Stages of Group Development:**
1. **Forming:** Polite, uncertain (Week 6 team formation)
2. **Storming:** Conflict, role negotiation (Early Videothon)
3. **Norming:** Cooperation, shared goals (Mid-Videothon)
4. **Performing:** Efficient, effective (Late Videothon, if lucky)

**The Videothon Accelerates This:**
- No time for prolonged storming
- Teams must norm quickly or fail
- Pressure forces communication

**Leadership Emerges:**
- Natural leaders step up
- Or teams struggle without clear direction
- Both are learning experiences
