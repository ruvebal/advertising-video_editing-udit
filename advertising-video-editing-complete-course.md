> — Tao of the Video Editor

---

## Course Overview

This 10-week Advertising Video Editing course is a practice-driven exploration of video editing within the context of persuasive media and advertising. The class combines film theory, technical mastery, and critical experimentation in an **atelier-style learning environment** (studio-based, "learning by doing") to achieve excellence in both creative and technical skills.

Students will trace the evolution of editing techniques from early cinema pioneers (Lumière Brothers, Georges Méliès, Segundo de Chomón) through the Soviet montage school (Lev Kuleshov, Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein) up to modern auteurs like Quentin Tarantino, examining how each era's innovations inform advertising today.

The curriculum emphasizes **practice-oriented research** – students actively experiment with techniques and reflect critically on outcomes – and **critical media literacy**, exploring concepts such as "the medium is the message" (Marshall McLuhan) and Guy Debord's "society of the spectacle." 

> *"To edit is to choose; to choose is to reveal your values. The ethical editor knows that every frame carries responsibility."*

## Teaching Methodology

### The Atelier Model

The course follows an **atelier model of teaching**, meaning class sessions resemble a creative workshop guided by the instructor (as a "master" facilitator) with students learning through active practice and iterative feedback.

Each week is split into **two 2-hour sessions**:
- **Session A:** Short lecture/seminar introducing theory and exemplars, followed by screenings and analysis
- **Session B:** Hands-on lab where students apply concepts immediately in exercises or ongoing projects

This **"learning by doing" approach**, coupled with research-based learning, encourages students to experiment (try a technique, review the result, learn from mistakes) in a supportive environment.

### Practice-Oriented Research

Students treat their creative exercises as experiments:
1. **Formulate** ideas based on theory
2. **Test** them in edits
3. **Evaluate** outcomes through critique
4. **Iterate** based on feedback

This blurs the line between making and inquiry – you're not just learning about editing techniques, you're discovering them through practice.

### Studio Classroom Environment

The instructor provides:
- Guidance and demonstrations
- Targeted mini-lectures (20-minute technique demos)
- One-on-one consultation during lab time
- Live troubleshooting and problem-solving

Students engage in:
- Active editing during class time
- Screening drafts and work-in-progress
- Collective critique sessions
- Peer learning and feedback

> *"In the studio, every student is both teacher and learner. The cut you make teaches the cut I will make."*

### Scaffolded Learning

Content is organized **historically as a narrative** (pacing through editing history and theory) while simultaneously **building technical skills week by week**:

- **Weeks 1-2:** Foundations (storytelling, early cinema, Premiere basics)
- **Weeks 3-5:** Core techniques (continuity, montage, experimental)
- **Weeks 6-7:** Advertising focus (formats, team videothon)
- **Weeks 8-9:** Advanced skills (post-production, ethics, platforms)
- **Week 10:** Showcase and reflection

### Critical Integration

Throughout the course, we integrate **critical media studies discussions**:
- Naomi Klein's *No Logo* (on branding and consumerism)
- Jean Kilbourne's work on gender in ads
- Guy Debord's critique of spectacle
- Marshall McLuhan on media as message

Students question the ethics of persuasion and envision more responsible storytelling, understanding that "news, propaganda, advertising, entertainment" are all part of the spectacle of society.

By course end, you'll have not only technical proficiency but also a **critical lens** on the messages you create.

> *"The editor who understands only technique is a craftsperson. The editor who understands meaning is an artist. The editor who questions ethics is a philosopher."*

## Assessment & Projects

To balance theoretical understanding with practical output, course assessment comprises three main components:

### 1. Advertisement Analysis (25%)
**Learning Through Critical Deconstruction**

Early in the term, each student conducts a critical analysis of an existing short advertisement or iconic edited sequence.

**Requirements:**
- Choose a 30-60 second advertisement (from provided list or approved proposal)
- Break down how the piece is edited: shot selection, pacing, transitions, sound integration
- Explain why those choices effectively (or ineffectively) persuade the audience
- Reference course concepts: Kuleshov Effect, Gestalt principles, continuity/montage theory
- Comment on ethical dimensions: Does it perpetuate stereotypes? Manipulate attention? Reinforce problematic norms?
- Connect to media theory: "the medium is the message," Debord's spectacle, Kilbourne's critique

**Deliverable:**
- Short essay (1000-1500 words) OR
- In-class presentation (10 minutes) with video examples OR
- Video essay (3-5 minutes) analyzing the ad

**Example Analysis:**
*A student analyzes an emotional charity PSA, noting how it uses Kuleshov-style juxtapositions – happy family images cut with product shots – to imbue the product with positive emotion, and how tight continuity editing ensures the narrative is clear and satisfying. They critique how the ad exploits empathy while questioning whether the charity's actual impact matches the emotional manipulation.*

**Due:** Week 4

> *"To understand the cut, first you must see the cut. To see the cut, you must look beyond the surface."*

### 2. Team "Edit-On-Camera" Videothon (25%)
**Collaborative Creative Experiment Under Constraint**

Around mid-semester, students participate in a fast-paced team project simulating real-world creative sprints.

**The Challenge:**
In small teams of 3-4, conceive, shoot, and edit a short ad **within a single extended session** (or 48-hour window). The twist: you're encouraged to **"edit on camera"** – planning shots in sequence so the narrative is largely achieved through how you shoot, harking back to early filmmakers who had to get scenes in-camera.

**Process:**
1. **Planning Session (Session 6A):** Teams draw a brief (product/cause + target audience), brainstorm concept, create detailed storyboard/shot list
2. **Production (Between sessions or Session 6B):** Shoot the video with minimal post-production in mind
3. **Quick Polish:** Minimal editing in Premiere (trimming, adding title/music)
4. **Screening & Critique:** Present to class, discuss process and outcomes

**Constraints:**
- 1-minute maximum length
- 5-10 shots maximum (encourages intentional composition)
- No fancy post-production effects
- Must plan transitions (natural wipes, continuous action, pause button creativity)

**Learning Goals:**
- Teamwork and collaboration under pressure
- Importance of pre-production planning
- Understanding editing through its absence
- Creative problem-solving and happy accidents
- Respect for the craft of in-camera storytelling

**Grading Criteria:**
- Concept clarity and creativity (30%)
- Planning thoroughness (storyboard quality) (25%)
- Execution and technical competence (25%)
- Team collaboration and process (20%)

- Hollywood's development of **continuity editing** (1910s-1920s)
- D.W. Griffith and the rules: 180° line, shot/reverse-shot, matching action
- Goal: **invisible editing** – cuts the audience doesn't notice
- **Gestalt psychology principles:**
  - **Continuity:** Viewers expect continuous movement/perspective
  - **Closure:** Viewers mentally fill gaps
  - **Proximity/Similarity:** We group related shots together
- **Screening:** Classic movie scene (dialogue from *Casablanca* or action from Marvel film)

- **Key insight:** Editing generates meaning not inherent in individual shots
- **Dziga Vertov** and *Man with a Movie Camera* (1929): "Kino-eye" theory, rapid montage of city life
- **Sergei Eisenstein:** Montage types (metric, rhythmic, tonal, intellectual) – collision of images sparks emotional/intellectual responses
- **Application to advertising:** Product shot + smiling people = product inherits positive emotions via juxtaposition
- **Screening:** Kuleshov Effect demonstration, Vertov montage sequence, Eisenstein's Odessa Steps

**Session B – Creating Your Own Kuleshov Experiment**

- **Exercise:** Mini-Kuleshov experiment
  - Given raw footage (or using still images), create 3-shot sequences
  - Face reacting + two different cutaways
  - Swap sequences with classmates, note how context alters interpretation
- **Advanced Exercise:** Intellectual montage
  - Combine two unrelated clips to suggest abstract idea
  - Example: Slaughtered bull + workers = oppression (Eisenstein style)
- **Adobe Techniques:**
  - Juxtaposition and pacing for emotional impact

- Why break continuity? Create energy, defy smooth Hollywood style, remind viewers they're watching a film
- **Quentin Tarantino:** Nonlinear editing in *Pulp Fiction* – story told out of chronological order
- **MTV-style editing (1980s onward):** Quick montages, stylized transitions, breaking the fourth wall
- **Discussion:** How do non-traditional edits affect viewer psychology? Distracting or exciting?
- **Application:** In advertising, breaking rules can grab attention in endless content scroll

**Session B – Experimental Editing Exercise**

- **Exercise:** "Break the Rules Intentionally"
