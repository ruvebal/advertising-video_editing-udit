### Our Approach to AI

> *"AI exists to AMPLIFY human intention, not to replace it."*

We follow these principles:

- **AI as Apprentice** — The professor decides; AI proposes
- **AI as Amplifier** — AI handles the mechanical; humans handle the meaningful
- **AI as Teacher** — We ask AI to explain, not just to do
- **Human Oversight** — All AI-generated content is reviewed, verified, and understood before use

### Ethical Commitments

This project aligns with established ethical frameworks:

- **ACM Code of Ethics** — Contribute to society, avoid harm, be honest
- **UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendation** — Proportionality, safety, fairness, sustainability, human oversight, transparency

### The Human Flourishing Test

Before every AI-assisted task, we ask:

1. Does this **reduce suffering** or **increase joy**?
2. Am I **learning** through this process, or just **copying**?
3. Will my future self **thank me** for this work?

### Transparency

- All code has been reviewed and understood by the author
- Security implications have been evaluated
- The author assumes full responsibility for the final implementation
